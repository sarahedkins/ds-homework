| Create a table of descriptive statistics for each of the variables (n, mean, median, standard deviation) | | | | |
| Describe the distributions of your data | | | | |
| Plot box plots for each variable | | | | |
| Create a covariance matrix | | | | |
| Determine any issues or limitations, based on your exploratory analysis | | | | |
| Outline exploratory analysis methods | | | | |
