"If you're having trouble trying to be more innovative, non-linear thinking may be just what you need to find your creativity. ",2016-11-11T20:00:15+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Growth Opportunities, Innovation, Personal Productivity, Planning for Growth, Productivity]",Planning for Growth,Heather Willems,"The Power of Non-Linear ThinkingHeather WillemsCo-Founder, Image ThinkHi there, you can call me Heather. Im Co-Founder at Image Think and Im based in Brooklyn, NY.Theres a lot of pressure in the business world these days to be innovativeto think differently."" But how do you create the kinds of conditions that help you come up with new ideas?Ill share a little secret with you about how artists do it: They dont think linearly.In my job as a graphic facilitator, I work with Fortune 50 businesses to help them reach their goals using visuals. My job is to encourage creative thinking and to help connect the dots between ideas in a way that offers an alternative perspective on how to solve the problem at hand.And to do that, I often have to coach people on how to overcome their habit of thinking linearly, which is the idea that there is one direct answer to a problem: A + B = C.But this approach can be very limiting. It can lead to getting stuck in tunnel vision. Its critical, therefore, to step back and make space for your intuition to see the broader picture as a way to spark new ideas.This is where non-linear thinkingwhere A + B + Cbecomes so valuable. It offers you a broad perspective on how to solve a problem. You use your insight, intuition, creativity and emotion when communicating information.This is the lesson we can learn from artists. It is rare that artists can sit down at a blank canvas and instantly make a masterpiece. Rather, they first have to gather research, tap into their insight and then practice creative thinking by working and re-working the canvas. When caught in a tough spot, they have to make space for intuition, to unveil the answer to the challenge at hand. This is non-linear thinking at work.As an example, when Im in my studio, I always surround myself with inspirationfound objects, poems tacked to the wall, a postcard of a painting at the museum or drawings made with a peer over a luncheon. It is a collection of thoughts and ideas; it is my research.Each item is a piece of a puzzle that could provide a solution to the problem at hand.The lesson here for businesspeople and entrepreneurs is that if you give yourself time away from your worktime to read a book or go for a walk or to socialize with friendsyou are far more likely to prepare your brain for a breakthrough than if you continue to sit at your desk and slog away. Your best work can actually get done when you are taking a break.""To that point, I love this quote from the comedian John Cleese: This is the extraordinary thing about creativity: If just you keep your mind resting against the subject in a friendly but persistent way, sooner or later you will get a reward from your unconscious.""I realize this goes against much of what gets taught in business about being productive"" or even that you might feel guilty in some way if you arent working."" But I have found that if you learn to embrace non-linear thinking like an artist does, you can generate so many more creative and new ideas than if you continue working the way you do now.As another example from my own life, I was due to give a presentation to a large audience in Sweden a while back. I was giving myself the hardest time because I couldnt just sit down and write an outline and do the research I thought I needed to do. I couldnt make things come together linearly. Instead, I read articles on the internet. Or called a colleague in my field for coffee. Or I just drew as I thought. I was doing anything and everything other than what I was supposed to be doing"".But then, inspiration struck. I woke up in the middle of the night with an idea. All the pieces I needed for my speech were there. I got out a stack of colored index cards and started writing down the topics of my speecheach of which came from the reading I was doing or the conversation I was having with my friend. My brain was synthesizing my speech all along and I didnt even realize it!The key was giving my brain the break it needed to make the connections I was looking for.A funny footnote to this story is that right before I was about to give the speech to the 500 people in the audience, another speaker asked if he could look at my cards. But when I handed them over, he proceeded to drop them on the ground, where they scattered all over. Thats when I realized that I had neglected to number them in order.That meant that I was forced to wing my speech. But because of how it all came together, that speech was already embedded in my brain and I performed far better than if I had relied solely on my cards.So if you want to embrace your own creativity and intuition, here are some suggestions on how you can fuel your non-linear thinking:Ask yourself questions like: What other perspectives are there? Who else is talking about this? What would a physicist think about it? How about a neurologist, sculptor or a strategist?Go further by making coffee dates with colleagues or peers who work in an adjacent field as you.Read a diverse range of articles or visit a museum and start to synthesize connections and organizing thoughts between everything you are exposing yourself to. Take what you learn and see if you can transform it into something new.If you can embrace non-linear thinking like this, you can help open yourself up to look at a world filled with possibilities, rather than limitations.Photo: iStock",The Power of Non-Linear Thinking
"Huge growth may be possible for businesses of all sizes, even those that donâ€™t have the capital to go it alone. Here are some growth strategies to consider.",2016-11-09T22:30:34+00:00,Planning for Growth,Operations,"[Business Expansion, Business Plan, Cash Flow, Franchising, Growth Opportunities, Managing Money, Operations, Partnerships, Planning for Growth, Risk Assessment, ROI, Saving Money, Strategy, Best of OPEN Forum, Recommended Reads]",Planning for Growth,Andrew J.

Im Partner, M&A and Corporate Department at Jones Day and Im based in Washington D.C. Metro Area.Of course,small-business owners often want to growbut why, how and at what cost? What if the growth strategy distracts you from the core of your current business or requires large amounts of capital that can put the entire enterprise in jeopardy?Here arethree strategies that may help drive your business growth in a lower-risk and capital-efficient manner.Build a Franchising ProgramOver the last five decades, business format franchising has emerged as one of the leading growth strategies for product and service companies. The launch of a franchising program starts with an understanding of the strategic essence of this business structure.There are three critical components of the franchise system:the brand, the operating system and the ongoing support provided by the franchisor to the franchisee.The brand helps create demand, allowing the franchisee to initially obtaincustomers, and may include the franchisors trademarks and service marks, its trade dress and dcor, and all the intangible factors thatcreate customer loyalty and build brand equity.The operating system essentially tries to deliver on the promise, helping the franchisee to maintaincustomer relationships and build loyalty. Ongoing support and training helps provide the franchisee with the tools and tips to expandits customer base and build market share.The responsibly built franchise system helps provide value to its franchisees by teaching them how to get and keep customers, andhow to getthose customers to consume as many products and services as possible.Franchising mayprovide franchisors withthe opportunity to:Obtain operating efficiencies and economies of scaleIncrease market share and build brand equityBuild customer loyaltyAchieve more rapid market penetration at a lower capital costReach the targeted consumer more effectively through cooperative advertising and promotionSell products and services to a dedicated distributor networkReplace the need for internal personnel with motivated owner/operatorsShift the primary responsibility for site selection, employee training and personnel management, local advertising and other administrative concerns to the franchisee, licensee or joint venture partnerIn the typical franchising relationship, the franchisee also shares the risk of expanding the franchisors market share by committing capital and resources to the development of satellite locations modeled after the proprietary business format.Create Joint Ventures and Strategic AlliancesAnother capital-efficient growth strategy is the establishing of partnering relationships, in which two or more companies work together to achieve a specific purpose or attaincommon business objectives. Joint ventures, strategic alliances, cross-licensing and technology transfer agreements are all strategies designed to obtain one or more of the following:Direct capital infusion in exchange for equity and/or intellectual property or distribution rightsA capital substitute, where the resources thatwould otherwise be obtained with the capital are obtained through joint venturingA shift of the burden and cost of development (through licensing) in exchange for a potentially more limited upsideThese types of partnering arrangements have been used for a variety of business purposes and to meet intellectual capital leveraging objectives, including joint research and co-promotion, distribution and commercialization, and cross-licensing and sub-licensing of new technologies. The participants to these agreements could be at various points in the value chain or distribution channelfrom agreements by and among direct or potential competitors, to agreements by and among parallel producers to widen or integrate product lines, and to parties linked at different points in the vertical distribution channel to achieve distribution efficiencies.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Give careful thought to the type of partner youre looking for and the responsibilities each party will be contributing to the newly formed entity. As with raising a child, each parent will be making their respective contribution of skills, abilities and resources.[/pullquote]Here are the major differences between joint ventures and strategic alliances:Joint ventures are typically structured as a partnership or newly formed and co-owned corporation (or limited liability company) where two or more parties are brought together to achieve a series of strategic and financial objectives. If youreconsidering a joint venture as a growth strategy, you should give careful thought to the type of partneryourelooking for and the responsibilities each party will be contributing to the newly formed entity. As with raising a child, each parent will be making their respective contribution of skills, abilities and resources.Strategic alliancesare collaborative working relationships whereno formal joint venture entity is formed but where two independent companies become interdependentby entering into a formal or informal agreement built on a platform of mutual objectives, strategy, risk and reward. The relationships are commonly referred to as teaming, strategic partnering, alliances, cross-licensing and co-branding.Seek Co-Branding OpportunitiesCo-branding consists oftwo or more established brand names combining to bring added value, economies of scale and customer recognition to each product. With afocus on brand equity, companies with strong, quality-oriented brands may seek to create new sources of revenue and leverage their largest intangible asset: their reputation.However, the temptation to extend the equity and value of your brand into other areas may pose certain risks. There are quality-control issues, the risk of over-branding or misbranding from a consumer perspective, and product-liability issues. The key to successful co-branding often involves making sure the brand itself stands for something greater than the original product and that the consumers perception of the extended brand is a natural one.The information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

What sets your business apart from the competition? Determining your unique selling proposition can be a key to getting more customers.,2016-11-11T22:30:47+00:00,Getting Customers,Marketing & Sales,"[Advertising, Brainstorming, Branding, Business Plan, Cash Flow, Competitive Research, Critical Numbers, Customer Engagement, Customer Feedback, Customer Relations, Customer Research, Finding New Customers, Getting Customers, Making a Sale, Managing Money, Market Research, Marketing & Sales, Pivoting, Planning for Growth, Research, Sales Pitches, Strategy, Best of OPEN Forum, Optimize Your Day, Recommended Reads]",Getting Customers,Rieva Lesonsky,"USP 101: How to Uncover Your Unique Selling PropositionRieva LesonskyContributing Writer, SmallBizTrends.comI am a small business & entrepreneurship thought leader, advocate and journalist. My mission is to help people start and grow their own businesses, which Ive been doing for over 30 years.My company, GrowBiz Media is a custom content creation company focusing on small business and entrepreneurship. We create content for small business websites and major marketers wanting to connect to entrepreneurs. We also own the small business blog, www.SmallBizDaily.com.In todays competitive business environment, there may seem to be a nearly infinite number of options for your potential customers to choose from. No longer are buyers limited to local companiesthanks to the internet, theres a world of alternatives out there, and seemingly endless marketing messages barraging consumers. To make your business stand out from the crowd, it can be vital to identify your unique selling proposition (USP).A USP maybe especially important if your companyisessentially selling the same thing as other businesses in yourindustry. How can you determine what makes your business different from the rest? Here are six ideas to help.1. Study the best.To get a feel for a good USP, look around you at market-leading companies that do a good job of differentiating themselves. They dont have to be your competitors or even in the same industrythe goal is just to analyze what makes for a good USP. For example, with dozens of brands of smartphones and computers to choose from, why do people go crazy for Apple products? The USP of beautiful design, simple functionality and just plain cool makes Apple stand out.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]By researching how your competitors are marketing themselves, youll be better able to position your business as different (or even diametrically opposed).[/pullquote]2. Think benefits, not features.When developing your marketing message, consider how your product or service benefits customersnot just on its features. The same applies when youre coming up with your USP. For example, if you own a dry cleaner, focusing on the features of your business wouldnt be too exciting. Just like every other dry cleaner, your service gets clothes clean. Maybe you have a special feature, like using environmentally friendly dry cleaning methods. But its how these features benefit the customers that can be key. Instead of focusing on green cleaning in your USP, you might emphasize that customers can feel safe wearing clothes youve dry cleaned because no harmful chemicals are used.3. Consider the four Ps.Product, price, placement (that is, distribution channels) and promotional methods make up the four Ps of marketing, and each one of these factors can inspire elements of your USP. Do you deliver your products or services in an unusual way? For example, Dollar Shave Club made its name by selling low-priced mens shaving products online via a subscription modela distribution method that was new to the mens grooming industry. An unusually expensive (or inexpensive) product can be part of your USP; consider how well this tactic works for artisanal food creators.4. Get emotional.Creating a USP is often not a matter of logic. Like all sales and marketing tactics, a good USP typically relies on emotion. To identify your USP, you should understand why customers buy what you sell. Are they trying to impress the boss? Do they want to proclaim their status to their neighbors? Are they trying to appeal to the opposite sex? Do they believe what you sell will help bring their family closer? Are they passionate about a certain cause? Any of these emotions can be part of your USP.5. Find out why customers buy from your business.You mightconduct customer surveys and polls to find out why your customers patronize your business rather than your competitors. You can also talk to customers and get informal insights, and ask your salespeople to do the same. Keep your ears open and watch social media for what people say about your business. By getting customers insights and opinions, youll notice trends that may spark ideas for your USP. Perhaps customers prefer your fashion boutique to the one down the street because your selection of clothing is highly curated so shopping is easy, while the other stores racks are packed with mismatched items that take hours to dig through.6. Examine the competition.To hone a USP that makes your business stand out, it may help to know the USP of your competitors. Peruse their advertising, marketing and social media messages; visit their locations and websites to see what USP theyre promoting. By researching how your competitors are marketing themselves, youll be better able to position your business as different (or even diametrically opposed). A USP that is shared by others is, by definition, not unique, so while fast delivery might seem like a great USP for your pizza restaurant, it wont work if any of the other dozens of pizzerias in town have that same USP. Youll likely need to choose something different, like the fact that you deliver all kinds of Italian dishes along with pizza.Identifying your USP is not just for new businessesit can be an ongoing process. Your USP will likely change over time as the market changes and you introduce new products and services. Assess your USP on a regular basis to ensure that you, your salespeople and your employees are all on the same page. Only then can you convey your USP to your prospective customers through marketing, sales tactics and advertising.Read more articles about marketing and sales.A version of this article was originally published on November 6, 2015.

Its not as simple as just changing the name from the CEOs office, deciding to merge with another successful company or undergoing a shift in culture.

Keep things simple. Avoid trying to do too much at once. Stick to a goal. Define it with simplicity.Do It in SectionsConsider beginning by introducing the change into only one section of the company, which will act as the treatment group. The rest of the companythe unchanged sectionwill be the control group.Doing this may allow you to figure out the difference in productivity, morale and finances, which may ultimately determine whether the change has potential for success across the entire organization or if you shoulddo more tinkering before escalating it.Dont Stick to NumbersRemember those defined goals? Dont just make them about finances and figures. The emotional aspect may bejust as important. Ensure theres an emotional drive toward making a change. You cant overestimate the value of a dollar, and you cant underestimate heartstrings.Adopt Recognition ProgramsConsider setting standards by recognizing employees who are aiding the change. Tailor the rewards to specific actions and company values so other employees know what type of behavior might garner a reward. It may also show that youtruly appreciate and acknowledge your employees during this difficult time.Keep Communication Lines OpenIts notefficient to communicate change and then assume that employees are ready to go. Instead, look for feedbackand do it constantly. Consider leveraging surveys, team meetings and company-wide emails to ensure all employees are on the same page. Then you might use that feedback to adjust your change strategies.Organizational change can undoubtedly be stressful. But it may be stressful for all employees, from the top down, which is why it may be helpfulto maintain employee morale through clear communication, feedback and employee recognition.Read more articles about strategic planning.A version of this article was originally published on November 2, 2015.Photo: iStock",8 Strategies for Big (or Small) Organizational Changes
"When expanding your business, exporting to international markets comes with its own set of challenges. These four businesses share some lessons they learned the hard way.",2016-10-27T19:00:39+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Growth Opportunities, Importing & Exporting, Insurance, Operations, Planning for Growth, Product Development, Strategy, Grow Global]",Planning for Growth,Greg Sandler,"Lessons Learned: Four Stories From Experienced ExportersGreg SandlerWriting and Content Development Expert, ThinkGlobal Inc.Greg Sandler, an international trade and  B2B content development expert, has worked on a wide range of business integration and web development projects.

Check out his profile on LinkedIn or send him an e-mail.Success in exporting, like in any business endeavor, depends on paying careful attention to details and adjusting your strategy when things dont go as planned. From export insurance and import duties to intellectual property protection and customer support, here are four examples from American exporters who have learned from experience. If youre looking to grow your business by exporting, these lessons learned may help you, too.A Little Insurance Can Go a Long WayInsurance is one of those business costs that may seem like overkill, until something goes wrong.Hard Manufacturing, a Buffalo, New York-based manufacturer of hospital cribs, recently dodged a bullet by renewing its export credit insurance with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)just a few months before the company was faced with the possibility of writing off a $175,000 receivable. (Exporters often use credit insurance to protect against nonpayment by international buyers.)Hard Manufacturing began using EXIM Bank credit insurance in 2009, but cancelled the policy a few years later to save money. Fast forward to 2015: Gina Trubits, the companys controller, started getting nervous about some of the companys larger receivables.We have an extensive customer base in the Middle East, which has experienced quite a bit of instability lately,"" she says. As a company, the goal is to maintain the sales relationship, but in a way that keeps us profitable. I presented the argument that renewing our EXIM policy would give us that security.""So, Hard Manufacturing started using EXIM credit insurance again. At about the same time, the average number of collection days for several big customers began increasing dramatically. In fact, we had a customer in Saudi Arabia with a large balance that we insured,"" says Trubits. Months went by without payment, and it was beginning to look like a reality that we would have to file a claim for payment. We ended up collecting the money the day before I was due to file the claim.""Understand All Your Costs Before ShippingTJ Scimone, founder of Slice Inc., a manufacturer of scissors and box cutters based in San Jose, California, is a veteran exporter who has been navigating global waters for decades. But back in the mid-1990s, when he was still learning the nuances of world trade, Scimone owned another company that exported private label cigars.The company, called Private Label, sent a shipment of cigars to Europe. But no one had checked on the import duties, and the next thing Scimone knew the cigars were stuck in customs, pending payment of a $10,000 import tax.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]While its good to get the wins, you have look at exporting long-term, and you have to demonstrate that youre willing to support your products and do everything possible to demonstrate your commitment to supporting the customer.John Clark, president and CEO, Masterclock Inc.[/pullquote]It was our responsibility to do the homework,"" says Scimone. Of course I couldnt pass on that fee to my distributor because it wasnt their fault, it was my fault. So, I ate the entire thing.""More recently, a Slice customer tried to return some of the companys cutting tools from Europe to Slices contract manufacturing facility in China. But the customer declared the full retail value of the goods, not the wholesale price, and our factory got a $5,000 invoice from Chinese customs, which the factory refused to pay. So we just abandoned the goods at China customs because the value was less than the price of the import duties.""Intellectual Property Is EquityExcel Dryer Inc., a Massachusetts manufacturer of electric hand dryers, learned the hard way to implement a global approach to intellectual property protection. When Excel launched its XLERATOR line in 2001, it did not apply for trademark registration or patent the design in most international markets. As a result, foreign knockoffs have cost the American company hundreds of thousands of dollars.We became a victim of our success,"" says Denis Gagnon Jr., the companys vice president, international. We hit the radar of foreign manufacturers, which began pushing out cheap knockoffs that we are now fighting, after the fact, in every major market.""Excel learned its lesson. When the company introduced its ThinAir product line in 2015, it was careful to make sure it had trademark registrations and patents in place worldwide. Patents may not be worth the investment in every market you enter,"" says Gagnon. But the cost / benefit equation should be well considered in advance.""Customer Support Translates Into SalesJohn Clark, president and CEO of Masterclock Inc., knows a thing or two about international sales and marketing. The St. Charles, Missouri-based manufacturer of precision timing devices supports its products across a wide range of vertical markets in more than 100 countries, and that can create significant communication challenges around the world.One recent issue that opened my eyes was with a longtime customer of ours in South Korea,"" says Clark. We manufacture PC timing cards for their automation systems, and after we switched to a new format our customer could not get the system to work.""Clark says the two companies went back and forth for about six months trying to troubleshoot the integration problem. Masterclock engineers were unable to reproduce the issue in-house and did their best to provide guidance, but time differences and language barriers hindered the process.In an effort to support the customer, Masterclock asked the Missouri Department of Economic Development (DED) if the states local representative in Korea could help. So, late one night, central time in the U.S., Clark and his senior support team got on a Skype call with the customers team and the Missouri DED repwho was at the companys facility to help translate.Once we could communicate with them in real-time, we offered to send a working system to the customer,"" says Clark. After they received it on-site, we demonstrated that our system was functional, and helped them further identify where to focus to fix the problem.""Even while the bugs were still being worked out of the interface program, the customer had already placed a new order with Masterclock.While its good to get the wins,"" says Clark, you have look at exporting long-term, and you have to demonstrate that youre willing to support your products and do everything possible to demonstrate your commitment to supporting the customer.""Moreover, Clark adds: Performance and ethics can translate across cultures much easier than words can.""Photo: iStock",Lessons Learned: Four Stories From Experienced Exporters

She is the author of Locavesting,The Revolution In Local Investing And How To Profit From It.Brynn Putnam may seem like an unlikely entrepreneur. A former professional ballerina, she danced with the New York City Ballet before hanging up her pointe shoes at the ripe age of 26. But that dancers pursuit of excellence, along with her natural inquisitiveness, led Putnam to start Refine Method, a boutique gym that has grown in five years from a 500-square-foot studio on Manhattans Upper East Side to three permanent locations across New York City.The idea struck her while she was working part time as a fitness instructor in between dance roles. Why, she wondered, did so many clients work out so hard but not achieve their desired results?Theres so much misinformation about fitness out there,"" she notes. So Putnam, who has a degree in Russian literature from Harvard and describes herself as a natural student,"" set out to unravel the secrets of getting fit.Sculptingthe Perfect WorkoutShe spent a year traveling the country and talking to some of the leading minds in fitness, particularly those that trained professional athletes, with a mission of taking those techniques to the mainstream. The result was Refine Method, which she opened in 2010 and bills as New Yorks smartest workout.""Brynn Putnam, Refine Methods founderThe fitness world is broken down into bucketstheres cardio, strength and flexibility,"" she says. In fact, your body responds to stimuliit doesnt know if youre lifting a kettle bell or your child.""With Refine Method, Putnam seeks to break down those barriers, using basic exercises that dont require expert coordination, flexibility or strength and are easily scaled up or down depending on the clients ability. She teamed with MIT to design her own equipment, a set of versatile Pilates-like cables that can fit in just three feet of space. And she uses technology to help deliver a customized experience in a small group setting, even as she has expanded.Refine Methods classes are capped at about 15 people.The approach has quickly caught on, and Putnam has expanded from her original gym to two additional locations, as well as a pop-up"" that she ran for a yearroughly one new location each year.Putnam funded Refine Method with her own savings, and has grown it organically. That means trade-offs: For example, she has to be creative about leasing space in Manhattan, where real estate prices can be sky-high. That also means sacrificing prime street-level locations for basement studios and other less expensive space. The first location she opened, on East 71st Street, is a 500-square foot space in a Russian Orthodox church that she clears out every Saturday evening so that the room can be used for the congregations Sunday lunch.Relocatinga Businessin the Wake of a HurricaneOther locations have proved challenging in different ways. Putnams second location seemed ideal for a fitness studio, but the landlord turned out to be difficult. So she decided to relocate, exercising a clause in her agreement that let her out of the lease. The only problem? The studio had to be emptied by midnightand Hurricane Sandy had just devastated the Northeast the day before. Downtown New York was in a total blackout, and there wasnt a single light in her studio to help her see, let alone tear down and move Refine Methods custom-made equipment.Putnam demonstrating a workout on Refine Methods custom-made equipment.Relocate a fitness studio in the middle of a hurricane in a blackout? The closest emotion I can describe it to is stage fright,"" explains Putnam. Like youre standing in the wings and you realize that you have this incredible opportunity to move your business forward in a positive way, but that you also may go out on stage and fall on your butt.""Putnam called her staff to inform them of her decision to move, and put out an urgent plea for light sources. Equipped with a camping lantern, a glow stick and cell phones that still had some battery life, Putnam and her team worked together to disassemble the custom equipment, gather the kettle bells and carry them down three flights of stairs to the street,only to face another hurdle: The nearby storage facility they planned to stash everything in was closed due to the storm.On the dark sidewalk, surrounded by medicine balls, kettle bells, lockers and metal bars from her custom pulley system, Putnam decided to call American Express customer service for help. American Express helped us find the storage unit, she said, even in the middle of the blackout, allowing Putnam to successfully complete the move.[pullquote alignment=""center""]It was just a truly empathetic and human experience for me dealing with American Express.Brynn Putnam, founder, Refine Method[/pullquote]But Putnam wasnt out of the woods yet. We were going to need to not only deal with the loss of revenue from closing down the location so abruptly, but also purchaseall of the new equipment and the new items for our new space, Brynn recalled. It was just a truly empathetic and human experience for me dealing with American Express. Everyone was wonderful, and customer service worked with us to figure out a flexible payment schedule that would help give us the time we needed to rebuild.""ExpandingOnto the National StageThat human touch is important to Putnam, especially since she strives to offer the same to her clients and staff. The idea, says Putnam, is to get to know the client beyond, did they have a knee injury.""

"Clint Greenleaf may not know everything about peanut butter, but by listening to experts, building a great team and knowing when to ask for help, he's building HomePlate Peanut Butter one squeeze pack at a time.",2016-11-02T20:30:59+00:00,Planning for Growth,Strategy,"[Industry Trends, Planning for Growth, Product Development, Strategy, A Day in the Life]",Planning for Growth,Rod Kurtz,"A Day in the Life: A Hungry Serial Entrepreneur Enters the Peanut Butter GameRod KurtzEditor-at-Large, OPEN Forum, American Express OPENHi there, you can call me Rod. Im Editor-at-Large, OPEN Forum at American Express OPEN and Im based in Greater New York City Area.For Clint Greenleaf, the journey to CEO of a peanut butter company has been an unlikely one. After training with the Marines in ROTC, he became an accountant and ""retired"" at the age of 22. He self-published a book on mens style and etiquette, after friends bet him he couldnt, which led him to launch a successful independent publishing company. By his own admission, Greenleaf has always had a big entrepreneurial appetite.In 2011, after growing Austin-based Greenleaf Book Group from zero to $10 million in revenue, with more than 40 best-sellers to its credit, he sold the company and began looking for his next entrepreneurial adventure. Through mutual friends, he connected with a group that was thinking about launching a new brand of peanut butter and was looking for an experienced CEO. After studying the peanut butter market, which was largely split into two categoriestasty but full of junk, or healthy but unappetizingGreenleaf and his team realized there had to be a happy medium. With its simple formula of just four ingredients (peanuts, cane sugar, palm fruit oil and salt), HomePlate Peanut Butter was born.The companys name, and the reason why seven former professional baseball players make up HomePlates investors, stems from a little-known fact: According to Greenleaf, starting as early as Little League, into the farm system and minor leagues, all the way to the majors, ballplayers have long relied on peanut butter as a quick, convenient source of healthy carbs and protein. We may see them chewing bubble gum or spitting sunflower seeds on the field, but its peanut butter that fuels some of our favorite players.And the company is clearly onto somethingthe Major League Baseball Clubhouse Managers Association has named HomePlate its official peanut butter, and it can now be found in the clubhouses of all 30 Major League Baseball teams. For the rest of us who cant hit a ball 450 feet, HomePlates line of Creamy, Crunchy and Honey peanut butters can be found on Amazon and on the shelves of some 500 stores, primarily in Central Texas for now, with plans to expand to another 1,000 by years end.But lest you think Greenleaf spends all his time in the bleachers at Fenway and Wrigley, he faces the same challenges and hectic day-to-day of founders at many fast-growing companies.We recently spent A Day in the Life with Greenleaf and three members of his team, as they traveled from Austin to Fitzgerald, Georgia, for a check-in session with their packaging manufacturer.9:54 a.m. ""We flew in to Atlanta that morning for a quick trip. It was important for us that the whole team came, so we can have a better understanding of the operation. On the phone, its easy to get distracted by other things. When youre sitting in the conference room with experts, its easy for them to grab someone down the hall to add some insight. You dont get that over the phone or on Skype. Also, they get to see that youre genuinely interested.""In a relative commodity space, you want to lean on your vendors. Thats one of my big tenets. You want to lean on them to know what youre doing well and what youre doing differently, and insights on industry trends and opportunities. We made this visit so we could talk to them about not only producing more product and allowing my team to see the operation, but adding new products. The four of us are talented in different areas, but why not go to the experts?""9:55 a.m. ""Caleigh, to my left, is our marketing managershe controls our brand messaging and works with retail to help broaden the messaging of the company. Sara, in blue, is our director of sales. Her job is to get product into stores and off the shelf. Allie, in the jacket, is our logistics associate and admin, who communicates with our baseball contacts.""We tried to pick people who had industry experience. Caleigh worked at a wine company, Sara worked at a food-brokerage company. The vendors act as two or three additional employees, if you manage it correctly. Its trying to find a lot of those Venn diagram cover pointsas much coverage as possible.""10:17 a.m. ""This facility doesnt actually make the peanut butterthey package it into our squeeze packs. Listening to Justin, a sales manager, say you want to avoid this or avoid that is huge for us. And thats a lot more important to me than negotiating price. When I dont know anything about the industry, its good to get expert help from anyone who can give it to you.""10:43 a.m. ""A meeting like this comes down to the personal connection you make, rather than what you see while youre there. Peanut butter is a fairly simple productthe main purpose of the visit is making the personal connection. So you spend the majority of your time in meetings. We cant take ourselves too seriously. Just because youre working doesnt mean you have to be miserable.""11:08 a.m.""Here, Justin is talking about the limitations that his equipment can handle. You walk in with a wish list and you realize that youre not going to get everything. Its not about yes, we can do it or no, we cant do itbut you see whats possible. Knowing that helps us avoid shopping around for other people.""11:15 a.m.""A lot of this is letting the manufacturing company talk more, as opposed to it being The Clint Show. Theyre all experts. Part of my job is to shut up and get out of the way.""11:32 a.m. ""These are some of the other products that they make: Showing us their capabilities, having us think outside of our box, trying to decide what that right mix might besqueeze packs versus cups, for example. And knowing what they do makes it easier for us to figure out what we want. Seeing other capabilities is good data for us.""11:49 a.m. ""Taking notes of current product and identifying ways we can improve is essential. I think the general rule is that we never want to do a straight reprint or a straight repackage. Its about increasing or decreasing the font size, for examplewe want to improve every time we do it. Thats part of our core message: Were not always going to get it right the first time or come up with improvements every time, but were going to continue tweaking and see what works best.""12:23 p.m.""The squeeze packs are primarily a sampling tool for us, but a lot of it comes down to the exact placement of words and images, where their hand covers it, etc. We found that when someone holds [the squeeze pack], their thumb covers part of it. If we add a coupon to it, where does it go? How will people notice it without missing the rest of the package? Its an easy, on-the-go snack, its an easy way to sample without buying a whole jarits even TSA compliant. Its transportable. Its sackable in moms purses or someones gym bag.""12:50 p.m. ""This is Chris. Hes an in-house FDA expert. Rather than us paying a consulting firm thousands of dollars for that information, we have access to him in-house. He briefed us on different food guidelines, packaging requirements and labeling issues we need to know about. The general progression from Marine to accountant to book publisher to peanut butter CEO is less than standard, so Im willing to admit what I dont know. And when you ask for help, people are more than willing to give it, rather than getting in the room and telling everyone how smart you are.""1:30 p.m. ""This is a proof sheetthe way the squeeze pack film is madewhich is 32 per sheet. It comes on a gigantic roll, so you make a large run. Caleigh is proofreading and checking the information on there. The minimum run of a squeeze pouch is about 100,000 at a time. So its a big commitment when youre not quite sure what youre going to do with them. This was the second time we ran them. Slightly less frightening, but still important.""2:45 p.m. ""This is us prepping to walk in the plant, which is unfortunately top secret. Food safety is obviously a big deal and one of the reasons you go on a trip like this is a backup check, to make sure theyre taking your product as seriously as you do. This only works because every one of us was dressed like an idiot. You go through a second change in the other plant. You laugh about it. Its a strange uniform, but its a team-building, bonding experience.""Honestly, I never thought I would wind up as a peanut butter CEO. It wasnt exactly my lane. But its how you define the lane. You end up finding that your lane should be things that matter to youand for me, its the upside, intellectual curiosity and the excitement. If you have those things, I dont really care what the industry is.""Photos: Steve Glass",A Day in the Life: A Hungry Serial Entrepreneur Enters the Peanut Butter Game
Want your business to stand out? Invest in delighting your customers! Learn how the Kano Model can help take your customers' satisfaction to the next level.,2016-11-01T13:30:03+00:00,Planning for Growth,Research,"[Brainstorming, Competitive Research, Customer Research, Planning for Growth, Product Development, Research]",Planning for Growth,Bruna Martinuzzi,"Can the Kano Model Help Your Company Stand Out?Bruna MartinuzziPresident and Founder, Clarion Enterprises Ltd.Bruna Martinuzzi is the CEO of Clarion Enterprises Ltd., specializing in leadership and presentation skills training. She is the author of Presenting with Credibility (2012) and The Leader as a Mensch (2009). Bruna has helped thousands of individuals become more effective communicators. www.clarionenterprises.comAre you aware of the Kano Model of customer satisfaction? Its the brainchild of Noriaki Kano, a professor at Tokyo University. Dr. Kano developed the Kano Model to help companies improve customer satisfaction. It encourages companies to be more strategic about the features they include in their products or services.As you develop a customer satisfaction strategy, you likely have a gut feel on what currently works in your company and what doesnt. But you may not be able to implement all of your customer satisfaction ideas right now. Ithelps to have a structured, analytic approach, such as the Kano Model, to help you prioritize your customer satisfaction efforts.How Does the Kano Model Work?The Kano Model starts by asking you to classify theattributes of your product and service in four main categories:Threshold Requirements:These are the basic features your customers expect. They dont increase customer satisfaction because they are taken for granted. Kano calls these ""Must-Bes."" Without them, the product or service would be incomplete. An example would be windshield wipers on a car.Performance Requirements:These are features that are not essential, but are known. (For example, heated seats and steering wheels.) Performance features can increase customer satisfaction, and customers may be willing to pay more for such features. They may be features that customers look for when evaluating your product or service against your competitor.Excitement Requirements:These are features that customers are not aware they want, but theyre delighted when they find them. An example would be forward-collision warning. This is the ""wow"" factor that can generate a pleasant surprise. Kano calls these ""Delighters."" Doing more here may help set you apart from the competition.Indifferent Attributes:These are the features that customers dont view as necessary. Having these features doesntincrease customer satisfaction, but their absence doesnt cause customer dissatisfaction either. An example would be having a car guide in several languages.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Bruna Martinuzzi"" alignment=""center""]Ithelps to have a structured, analytic approach, such as the Kano Model, to help you prioritize your customer satisfaction efforts.[/pullquote]The Kano Model can offer many potential benefits. For example, it may be a useful tool for:identifying, or better understanding, what your customer needs from your product or service.providing insights for the initial concept development.making it easier to prioritize your ideas for improving customer satisfaction.analyzing your competitors products and services.helping you stand out from your competition.How to Use the Kano Model to Help Increase Customer SatisfactionThe Kano Model offers a structured and helpful approach to assessing your product and services with customer satisfaction in mind.First, the model has you brainstorm all of the possible features that can please your customers. Does your product or service include all the essentials that are taken for granted? What extras can you include that can help you stay competitive? Beyond the extras, what can you do to overdeliver? What can you do thats out of the ordinary, that can delight your potential customers?The next step issorting out the results of your brainstorming into four categories: Must-Haves, Performance, Delighters and Not Relevant.The Kano Model asks you to ensure that you meet all of the Must-Haves, or threshold requirements. According to the model, these should be your top priority because their absence could cause dissatisfaction.The model also advises that you dont spend any time on features that fall into the Not Relevant category. They are likely to be a money sink. Consider removing them, if you can.Next, youll analyze the performance attributes in your list. Divide them into four categories to help you decide what you can focus on. The categories are solutions that:have a major impact on customer satisfaction and are also simple to implement,have a major impact on pleasing customers, but are very complex or expensive to institute,have a minor impact in increasing customer satisfaction, but are simple or inexpensive to add,have a minor impact on customer satisfaction and will be complex or expensive to institute.Finally, the Kano Model has you use the same process for delighters (i.e. your potential excitement generators). According to the Kano Model, these are the criteria that have the greatest influence on how satisfied a customer will be with a product or service. This may be a fruitful category to invest your effort in because it may differentiate your product or service from the competition. These attributes may also influence your potential customers to choose you in a crowded market where there are many other choices. It might give you an opportunity not to compete on price alone.Its important to note that in the Kano Model, no category is more important than another. Ideally, consider using a balanced approach where your product or service can satisfy all three main requirements.That is, it has all the basics that customers expect; its competitive in terms of performance (i.e. those features that people talk about and are more interested in); and finally, it has some delightersthe pleasant surprises that add to the customers enjoyment. A product or service that has all three of the Kano Model requirements may help you stand out in a copycat market.Read more articles onresearch.Photo: iStock",Can the Kano Model Help Your Company Stand Out?
"Creating a business around innovative technology services can be nerve-wracking, but for AeroVista Innovations, it meant a chance to become a drone pioneer.",2016-11-03T23:36:56+00:00,Building Your Team,Company Culture,"[Building Your Team, Company Culture, Digital Tools, Getting Customers, Growth Opportunities, Hiring & HR, Innovation, Planning for Growth, Team Structure, Team-Building Activities, Websites, Featured Member Stories]",Building Your Team,Anne Miller,"Featured Member: Brendan Stewart, co-founder of AeroVista InnovationsAnne MillerEditor, Anne MillerThis business owner is an OPEN Forum Member. If youd like to share your business story to be considered for a feature on OPEN Forum, please sign in or sign upandanswer a few short questions.More then a decade ago, Brendan Stewart dreamed of flying planes but couldnt afford the $120-per-hour plane fees. An engineer, he started building his own remote-controlled, unmanned planes.Its fun to be able to say, I remember when you had to build drones from parts, and they had no GPS enabled autopilot, he says.Stewarts early tinkering lead him on a path to help create AeroVista Innovations, in 2015his official title is co-founder and president of engineering. AeroVista offers aerial mapping and imagery as well as training and events with their unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs.Our AeroVista Drone Academy offers drone training for firefighters and law enforcement, as well as commercial operators, Stewart says. We also deliver STEM education programs for students in hopes of inspiring the next generation of drone pilots, engineers and entrepreneurs.1. How has your business grown?We started providing aerial photography and video imagery solutions. We soon realized that there was a bigger opportunity. Drones are disrupting traditional methods of data acquisition because they can deliver data in a safer, more efficient, cost-effective manner and ultimately provide better data. Strategically we needed to be at the leading edge of this industry so that we can evolve with it and lead through expertise and process. As a result, we have become leaders in aerial thermography, 3D mapping and modeling and training, and consulting. We continue to leverage our expert UAV operations and build training and consulting services to allow our major corporate clients to reap the benefits of drone technology without disrupting their business.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Making the leap into entrepreneurship was a pretty scary gap to cross. I make a concerted effort every day to keep perspective on where we are, where were going and exactly what Im going to have to contribute to get there.[/pullquote]Brendan Stewart, AeroVista Innovations co-founder and president of engineering2. What hurdles have you overcome in running your business?When we started up, regulatory compliance was an enormous hurdle. We started flying before the laws for drones were even written, so we were required to adhere to some of the same standards as commercial aircraft. We had to write long petitioning documents to the Federal Aviation Administration to allow us to be exempt from laws such as a pilot or crew member must be onboard at all times and other seemingly obvious things a UAV cant do. After seven months, we finally got the green light in March of this year. As of August 29, the skies have only gotten clearer with the FAAs adoption of the first ever set of federal laws regarding the use of drones.3. When did you first realize your company was successful?Id have to say it was somewhere between meeting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, or speaking in front of the National Association of Corporate Directors in Washington, D.C. Its really exciting to see others get as enthusiastic about your business as you are.4. How do you get more women involved in STEM careers in this industry and others?Lets start with some numbers. In the U.S., there are only about 600,000 licensed pilots (according to the FAAs 2015 Active Civil Airmen Statistics.)About 6 percent of those nearly 600,000 are women. The FAA expects the number of pilots to double in the next year due to the proliferation of drone technology. We as an industry need to expose young women to opportunities in STEM and aviation, and inspire them to become the pilots and engineers our industry needs to succeed.We added our AeroVista Drone Academy earlier this year to provide a trusted educational platform for emergency responders including firefighters and law enforcement for the use of drones in search and rescue and operational awareness. We support STEM educational curriculum for students and offer training for commercial pilots. In September 2016, we launched a new initiative, Women & Drones, which focuses on raising the profile and visibility of women in the UAV industry.5. What are three things you couldnt live without?First and foremost, my team. AVI wouldnt exist without the dedication, late nights, road trips to meet clients, and blood, sweat and tears of my partners. Im very fortunate to be part of such a collaborative environment. Our we focus is the secret to our success!I think Id have to put perspective second. Making the leap into entrepreneurship was a pretty scary gap to cross. I make a concerted effort every day to keep perspective on where we are, where were going and exactly what Im going to have to contribute to get there.Lastly, Id have to say flying. Its no secret that Im an aviation geek. The act of operating an aircraft is a cognitive and sensory experience that leaves your mind with no room to focus on anything else. Much like chess, its easy to learn and an unending challenge to master. I find it highly therapeutic.Photos: iStock, Courtesy of AeroVista Innovations","Featured Member: Brendan Stewart, co-founder of AeroVista Innovations"
"The thought of rebranding may give any man wrinkles. But Ernest Supplies owner John Cafarelli took the redesign of his men's skincare products in stride, thanks to good timing and support from American Express.",2016-10-25T14:35:01+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Brainstorming, Business Expansion, Business Plan, Growth Opportunities, Importing & Exporting, Industry Trends, Innovation, Planning for Growth, Product Development, Research, Strategy, American Express OPEN, Card Member Spotlight, Ready for Growth]",Planning for Growth,Cara Cannella,"How an Eye for Design Helped This Skincare Line GrowCara CannellaWriter & Editor, caracannella.comDesign matters, no matter what industry youre in. For John Cafarelli, the travel-friendly, durable packaging for his line of mens skincare products was revolutionary. Before launching New York-based Ernest Supplies in 2012, the investment banker-turned-entrepreneur brainstormed with a packaging designer about using ideas from other industries in surprising ways. Their goal was three-fold: to create buzz; minimize carbon footprint with a high product-to-packaging ratio; and preserve the formulations active ingredients (vitamins and antioxidants) from oxygen and UV light.For inspiration, they looked to glue and other industrial products. Then one day while in line at a coffee shop, Cafarelli noticed applesauce for sale in a squeezable, re-closeable pouch marketed to kids. The packages dimensions made for ""a great billboard, with more shelf-space to tell our story than a bottle has,"" says Cafarelli, who chose the name for his company, ""Ernest Supplies,"" for its dual association with the classic mans name and the straightforward sincerity of ""earnest.""John Cafarelli drew inspiration for Ernest Suppliespackaging by looking outside the skincare industry.The utilitarian design brought to mind military ration packs, in line with the masculine, Scandinavian-inspired branding he envisioned. ""Its perfect for so many reasons,"" he told his designer, who agreed.Next thing he knew, Cafarelli had quit his banking job and was sitting in his living room with a couple thousand pieces of product, waiting for people to buy from his then-rudimentary website. He launched with three basics of mens groomingface wash, shaving cream and moisturizer. As the creator of one of the first skincare lines in the United States to use this squeezable packaging format, he had to convince supply chain partners wary of introducing cosmetics to their food-grade assembly line.Impressing Buyersat Home and AbroadAlthough Ernest Supplies stand-up, spouted pouches have since won awards for packaging and graphic design, Cafarelli is always looking for ways to enhance the brands aesthetic and functionality. These high standards have attracted attention from some of the most discerning players in mens fashion and grooming, even earning him an invite to showcase his product at Pitti Immagine, a premier mens fashion trade show held in Italy every January and June.Founder John Cafarelli (left) speaks with David Pirotta, whose eponymous brand agency helps distribute Ernest Supplies products.""Its a showcase for the coolest brands, with top buyers from all over the world,"" Cafarelli explains. ""I couldnt just say my product was premium. It had to look like the realdeal. Thats a lot of pressure for a young company.""In the months leading up to Ernest Supplies first big moment before an international audience, he attended Cosmoprof, a trade show in Las Vegas for beauty brands and suppliers. There he encountered a vendor who offered to sell him a bottle packaging machine. Not only was it exactly the piece of equipment he needed to up his game, but it was a floor model used for just a few days of trade show demos, offered at a steep discount.[pullquote alignment=""center""]I was able to use my American ExpressCard to purchase equipment I needed to give my packaging a facelift.John Cafarelli, founder, Ernest Supplies[/pullquote]""The thing was, I had to buy it on the spot,"" he recalls. ""I was not in any scenario going to Italy for this trade show without a new packaging format in hand. As a small business, it can be a real challenge to come up with thousands of dollars in a split second. Fortunately, I was able to use my American ExpressCard to purchase equipment I needed to give my packaging a facelift.""Thanks to the impression he made in Italy, Cafarelli secured deals with high-end American and European buyers who directed his products into the hands of affluentshoppers and influential style-makers.Standing Out in an Expanding MarketThough still a boutique operation, Cafarelli expects his self-funded company to double in size this year. Its organic growth has been fueled mostly by print and online coverage in influential media outletslargely the result of Cafarellis face-to-face meetings with editors, known as ""desksides"" in PR-speakand what he describes as a ""symbiotic"" partnership with Birchbox, the monthly cosmetics subscription service. Many subscribers who receive Ernest Supplies samples convert into customers, Cafarelli says. Birchbox, meanwhile, may also benefit from the partnership by increasing its customer value proposition as a curator of lesser-known boutique brands.Cafarelli showssamplesof Ernest Supplies products to David Pirotta Brands sales manager Chelito Villaflor.Focused more on customer satisfaction than on revenue generation at this stage, he points proudly to the companys 75 percent wholesale customer retention rate over the past year. ""The vast majority of my business is wholesale. We sell in about 125 stores around the country with a focus on placing products in stores with brand adjacencies,"" says Cafarelli. ""Weve been selective about where we want our premium skincare to fit in the brand landscape.""In the near future, Cafarelli foresees opening up a store, hosting events and concerts, and collaborating with designers across industries. Currently, hes partnering with a prominent New York industrial designer on a toiletry kit to complement his products. As Ernest Supplies becomes more well known and more prominent in the market, a wide array of opportunity abounds. ""I feel like the baby has grown up and has gone to college,"" he says.

"Although some small-business owners avoid franchising in order to grow organically, it may be a good option to help fuel your company's growth. ",2016-09-01T19:00:30+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Business Expansion, Franchising, Growth Opportunities, Planning for Growth, Business Expansion]",Planning for Growth,Christopher Conner,"Could Franchising Help Scale Your Business? You Might Be SurprisedChristopher ConnerPresident, Franchise Marketing SystemsI have worked in the franchise development industry since 2002 and help businesses grow through franchising. My company, Franchise Marketing Systems helps businesses grow through franchising and franchise development.As an entrepreneur, Im sure you remember the time before you started your business and probably worked for someone else. Most days, there would come a time where I stared at the clock, wondering when I could escape the confines of my job. I think, in general, I did good work and was a decent employee, but I know I didnt fill the room with a burning desire to make the company more money.Then, one day, I started my own business and my entire world changed. Work weeks all of a sudden included Saturday and Sunday, a light week was 80 hours and it was fun to try hitting a 20-hour work day. So if we, as business owners, are like this, why should it be any different for our employees? The fact is, human nature inherently drives us to care more about something we own than something we are given. Employees are less likely to be as driven and focused on their work as a business owner is.It comes down to the simple concept of having ""skin in the game."" When people have their own money and rear end on the line, they tend to work harder and be more focused on the results. This trait is extremely apparent when comparing strategies to grow a business in new markets. Managing employees when scaling a business makes the responsibility of keeping your staff motivated even more difficult, because you cant see them every day and monitor their work like you could if they were in the same location. I had a client in the oil services field say this to me after opening several franchise locations: ""I cant hire someone for $100,000 a year to work as hard as the guy who just invested $100,000 to open a business doing the same thing."" For this reason, I feel franchising has success in a wide range of industry segments.So why dont more businesses leverage franchise growth as a way to expand? It seems the first factor is just fear of the unknownsome business owners dont understand franchising and therefore choose organic growth or other options. In reality, the franchise model is a pretty simple concept, much like a partnership, but with better structure and less ""gray area"" in the agreement, which can plague partnerships.The second factor that seems to steer business owners away from franchising is the fear of losing control by opening the business up to franchisees. The first thing I ask business owners with this concern is how much control they have over employees in a location they arent overseeing every day. Generally, the realization is that franchising offers a different kind of control. Not the same control you might have if your management style is dictatorial and people respond to you because youre good at cracking the whip, but a control that is inherent when you put people in charge of their own destiny and they become accountable for their own profitability.The bottom line is that growing a business can be scary and means some version of change for you, your operations and your bottom line. With that change in your business, you may want to consider franchising as one of the options to fuel that growth. Ultimately, you want to avoid comparing franchising to how you currently run your businessinstead, its important to weigh it against other growth strategies available.For more tips on expanding your business, access Business Growth: How to Survive and Thrive, from MSNBCs Your Business.Photo: iStock",Could Franchising Help Scale Your Business?

Im Writer/Author/Publisher/Speaker at Garden Guides Press and Im based in Orange County, California Area.Record-setting summer rains in drought-stricken California. Hurricanes in Texas. Tornadoes in the Plains, flooding on the coast. These are all sudden curveballs small-business owners commonly have to deal with.""Just when you think things are cool, wham! A sucker punch,"" says Peter Boni, managing principal of Kedgeway and author of All Hands On Deck: Navigating Your Team Through Crises, Getting Your Organization Unstuck, and Emerging Victorious. ""It happens to outfits big and small. Sometimes its self-induced. The culprit could be lack of foresight and planning, or just bad management. Other times, external forces beyond anyones control can whack you.""Catastrophic EventsNatural disasters happen all the time all over the United States, from the floods in California and Texas, to the tornadoes in the Midwest, or hurricanes, adds Bill McBean, author of The Facts of Business Life: What Every Successful Business Owner Knows That You Dont. Successful business owners understand one important reality from those owners who are just hanging on or have had to close their businesses. They understand that what can be controlled must be. And what cant be controlled has to be contained.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]The realization that you cant handle things all by yourself is tough for some small-business people to recognize, but its imperative that you create a crisis team to help pull you through. Peter Boni, managing principal, Kedgeway[/pullquote]Natural disasters cant be controlled, but adequate insurance coverage may go a long way to helping lessen the blow of the unexpected, McBean notes. [You should]realize the importance of asset protection, that profits or sales would not be possible if the assets of the business arent protected. In reality, asset protection is more important than sales and profits, because assets create the tools and the inventory from which profits and sales are generated. Assets represent cash or credit already spent, and not protecting them is equivalent to leaving thousands of dollars on a park bench and hoping no one will take it.Always break down your assets into the controllable and uncontrollable ones, McBean adds. Then make intelligent decisions regarding all your assets in terms of how they can be protected after a disaster, so your business can survive to fight for market share when things calm down.""Whatever you do when presented with a challenge, try not to go it alone, Boni says. ""The realization that you cant handle things all by yourself is tough for some small-business people to recognize, but its imperative that you create a crisis team to help pull you through. Reach out to your staff, advisors and vendors and ask for assistance.""Other suggestions for disaster preparation:Consider developing a written, documented disaster preparedness plan and review it with your employees. You might determine how you will communicate with one another in the event of a crisis, and make sure the information includes emergency contact information for everyone.Communicate your disaster preparedness plan. Hold a meeting and run through potential disasters, where you might discuss your first and future steps.Determine chain of command. This may mean designating an employee to take over if youre out of town and unreachable, so you have someone you can rely on steering the ship while youre gone.You might share your plan with critical external contacts. If you rely heavily on outside vendors, such as computer support people, sharing your potential disaster plan with them may help them know what to expect and do if something does occur.Consider an alternative operation site. If a natural disaster strikes, you probably wont want to have to scramble to find an alternate location. Deciding ahead of time where that will be may help.Back up frequently. Loss of data may be a small-business owners biggest potential threat. Backing up into a cloud, daily, may helpensure your data is safeThe Other Sideof DisasterWhen a storm has passed and your company is still standing, you may find it has made you a better business owner, Boni believes. ""It improves your judgment and your confidence when you overcome the storms. And it builds camaraderie. Those scars of experience build character for you and your team.""Surviving storms of adversity may also lead to increased business, McBean notes. ""One companys disaster can be another companys road to riches, he says. Like the floods of California, destruction causes reconstruction, and those small-business owners who covered themselves adequately can expand.Whatever you do, it may be best to stay away from what McBean calls the hope theory. In this case, small-business owners hope that unfortunate incidents simply dont happen, he says. The hope theory destroys businesses, because the unforeseen and mismanaged always catches up with you.For more tips on expanding your business, access Business Growth: How to Survive and Thrive, from MSNBCs Your Business.Read more articles about strategic planning.A version of this article was originally published on July 24, 2015.

"No matter what type of business you run, improving your efficiency can have a positive impact on your bottom line and services.",2016-10-14T13:30:58+00:00,Building Your Team,Leadership,"[Building Your Team, Business Plan, Leadership, Motivating Employees, Operations, Planning for Growth, Productivity, Risk Assessment, Strategy]",Building Your Team,Mike Michalowicz,"8 Efficiency Lessons Business Owners Can Learn From ManufacturersMike MichalowiczAuthor, Profit FirstI am the author of Profit First, The Pumpkin Plan and The Toilet Paper EntrepreneurIve always found it useful to be eclectic when it comes to looking for advice. You may think your dry-cleaning business or auto mechanic shop cant possibly learn from businesses that are in completely different industries, but you might be surprised at what you can learn if you open your eyes and mind.One of my businesses is a small manufacturing company, and it occurred to me the other day that Ive learned a lot from our successes and trials. Ive been able to put those lessons to use in my other business ventures to improve my efficiency. Here are a few of the things Ive learned from manufacturing that may be helpful to your company too:1. Eliminate waste.Whether its office supplies, raw materials or employees who arent earning their keep, you know there are measures you could take to cut costs.Manufacturers have learned that becoming more efficient can be difficult if they dont trim unnecessary costs and stop wasting time and money.2. Establish SMART goals.To improve efficiency, it helps ifeveryone in your organization understands your clearly defined goals. It also helps ifthose goals must be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-specificotherwise known as SMART goals.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Mike Michalowicz"" alignment=""center""]Even if youre in a service industry, efficiency is worth striving for, as it can always affect your bottom line.[/pullquote]If your company goals dont meet every single SMART criterion, then you and your staff may end up spinning your wheels in inefficient activities that can hurt your bottom line. Consider sitting down with your team to define your goals and make sure theyre SMART.3. Establish systems.If you or your employees must hand-manage every single task you need accomplished, you may become so mired in minutiae. And that can get in the way of efficiency.Consider taking a step back from your companys processes and look for ways to establish systemsportions of your business that you can automate. Systems can help free up you and your staff for more important hands-on tasks, thus improving efficiency. Scaling up requires systematization.4. Look for bottlenecks.Bottlenecks are points in your process that prevent you from running more quickly and efficiently. Theyre the sticking places where workflow gets gummed up. Bottlenecks can create backlogs that leave your staff idle, waiting to be able to do their jobsthey can be an efficiency killer.Whether your bottleneck is a task that might benefit from streamlining, or a person whos unable to keep up with the rest of your employees, when you identify and resolve bottlenecks, you may find that you can accomplish much more.5. Use key performance indicators (KPIs).In addition to setting SMART goals, savvy manufacturers use KPIs to evaluate their progress in achieving those goals. KPIs can help you make sure that your goals are clearly communicated to your staff by evaluating them on your prioritized tasks. If your staff knows what matters to you, they may be better able to help you achieve it.6. Establish quality controls.Whether youre manufacturing widgets or cleaning houses, providing excellent service and value to your customers is important. If you dont have a way to assess the quality of your finished product (and of the staff producing it), youmay find yourselfstruggling to wow your clients. Consider building assessment and evaluation into your processthis can help you learn how much more efficient you can be.7. Employ root cause analysis.Business owners often face troubles in their business,but the mostsuccessful entrepreneurs find ways to surmount them. Its important to avoid treating the symptoms of your problems, rather than the cause. Root cause analysis can help prevent just that.One of the simplest strategies you can use to make sure youre getting to the heart of your problem is to ask Why? until you actually arrive at the root cause. Take this forexample: A manufacturer of watches is having trouble delivering orders on time. She asks why. It turns out one portion of her factory is at a standstill. She asks why again. They dont have the materials they need to produce their component. She asks why. The materials havent been ordered. Why? Because the vendor went out of business.By asking why until she got to the real cause, the manufacturer discovers what her course of action should be. She can then find a new vendor and begin meeting deadlines once again. Root cause analysis is about getting to the actionable issues.8. Strive for continuous flow.Most manufacturers understand that streamlining their process can help ensure a smooth, continuous flow of work. An important part of streamlining is ensuring that clients are moved through your process without a hitch. What that means in practice is that if you have a marketing team handing leads to your sales team, that happens without customers getting stalled or neglected in between.Clients (like products in manufacturing) must be handed off from one department to the next without being dropped. If those handoffs arent seamless, you may not be as efficient as you could be. It helps to work toward making your workflow process as smooth and hassle-free as possible.Ice cream shops, accountants and home repair contractors alike can all benefit from learning from the strategies manufacturers use to become more efficient and profitable. Even if youre in a service industry, efficiency is worth striving for, as it can always affect your bottom line.Read more articles on planning for growth.Photo: iStock",8 Efficiency Lessons Business Owners Can Learn From Manufacturers

Success can attract more success, which can helpcatapult a company onto the Inc. 500or maybe evenonto the Fortune 500. But coupled with the benefits of fast growth can come tremendous risks.Some ofthese risks can be easy to miss, which can make them even more dangerous to the health of your company. Higher sales can mask the dangers that lurk inside a company that hasnt prepared its business operations to absorb rapidly increasing sales.For companies that have been blessed with rapid growth, its critically important to ensure that your operations can handle it. A company can quickly become overwhelmed with too much growth in too little time which puts it in a perfect position for bankruptcy. These areas require the most attention during periods of rapid growth:Cash-Flow ManagementRapid growth can consume tremendous amounts of cash. Your companymayrequire cash to expand its business operations to fulfill its contracts, which in all likelihood wont pay until 30 to 90 days after you have delivered. (Customers seldom pay in advance.)[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Mike Periu"" alignment=""center""]Using a low price as a way to entice many customers can help grow revenues, but it may leave little profitability. [/pullquote]If your growth rates change monthly, it can be difficult to determine exactly how much cash youll need over the next 12 months in advance. Underestimating this amount may lead to a cash shortage, which can hurt your ability to execute on customer projects.Pricing StrategySometimes growth happens very quickly because of pricing. Many owners may also feel the pressure to lower prices when their growth rate starts to dwindle as a way to sustain an unsustainable rate of growth.Using a low price as a way to entice many customers can help grow revenues, but it may leave little profitability. Those profits are what you can reinvest in your business to help fund future expansion and to command a higher valuation. It can also help access lower-cost financing, which can assist with cash-flow management.Human Resource ManagementFast growing companies need talented people. Finding the right person for a job can be a challenge; findingdozens of them every month on a consistent basiscan be considerednearly a miracle.Many companies commit the error of lowering their standards when it comes to hiring in order to keep pace with their growth. This candamage the companys culture and may eventually lead to poor performance. From the onset of rapid growth, it may be worthwhile to first hire a high-level executive with experience and contacts for quality recruiting.Infrastructure ManagementAn inadequate technology infrastructure can be a hindrance to a fast-growing company and its business operations. Slow computers and database management software, the lack of mobile compatibility and outdated network infrastructure are just some examples of technology that can do more harm than good.Many new solutions are scalable and come with variable pricing based on usage. Rather than try to work with an outdated information technology infrastructure, considerupdating what you have so that it can better serve the needs of your employees.Risk ManagementWith additional customers, sales, suppliers and employees can come additional risks. An accident or other circumstance could lead to a situation where your company is being sued. Yet many companies fail to increase their insurance coverage or add additional lines of insurance to reflect their now much-larger company. In addition to insurance protection, a fast-growing company may want to considerestablishing formal policies and procedures related to risk management before a problem occurs.For more tips on expanding your business, access Business Growth: How to Survive and Thrive, from MSNBCs Your Business.Read more articles on operations.Photo: iStock",The Role Business Operations Can Have in a Fast-Growing Company

But the stock markets ups and downs may beno different thanwhat happens when you run your own business. It might not occur in the space of a weeks time, but small businesses may experience economic ups and downs on a regular basis.No business is immune to the fickle and unpredictable nature of a competitive marketplace, says speaker and strategic consultant, Tom Panaggio, author of The Risk Advantage: Embracing the Entrepreneurs Unexpected Edge. All business climates are made up of a series of connected cycles, both positive and negative, that business leaders must accept as a risk and a cost for the opportunity to follow their entrepreneurial dreams.Tom Wheelwright agrees. I have never seen any business that didnt have ups and downs, says the author of Tax-Free Wealth: How to Build Massive Wealth by Permanently Lowering Your Taxes and CEO of ProVision Wealth Strategists. The stock market and economy in general affect all small businesses, because it causes customers to either hold on to their money or spend.While the overall economy maycreate some cyclical exposure for small businesses, most owners may be more in control of their destinies than they think, says DeAndre Salter, CEO of Professional Risk Solutions and author of Seven Wealth Building Secrets: Your Guide to Money and Meaning.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Never stop looking for ways to implement change, especially during tough times. When things get rough, weak competitors will go into hibernation, and this is when creative business leaders make their moves.Tom Panaggio, strategic consultant, author of The Risk Advantage[/pullquote]Even in down markets, people spend money and buy goods and services, Salter says. Better managed and capitalized businesses are the ones that prosper during the downturns. Its possible for small-business owners to come out ahead during downturns if they prepare for the ride. For instance, I dont like rollercoasters, especially those with really big hills and drops, but if I know Im visiting an amusement park, I research the drop, its height, speed, etc., so Im prepared for the trauma that will inevitably come my way.In order to survive and thrive no matter the economic times, there are several things you can do to help keep your small business on course.Always Keep MarketingMarketing is often the first budget that gets cut during a downturn, but it should be the last, Panaggio says. Cutting your marketing and sales is like turning off your engine in the middle of a car race. Let your competitors cut their marketing budgets and capitalize on their fear.When times are bad, dont give in to the fear and turn off the marketing engine to save money, agrees integrated marketing expert Bonnie Harris of Wax Marketing, Inc. Do whatever it takes to create as many income streams as possible, while getting serious in terms of ROI. Pursue less expensive marketing channels like online and content marketing and social media.Remain InnovativeNever stop looking for ways to implement change, especially during tough times, Panaggio says. When things get rough, weak competitors will go into hibernation, and this is when creative business leaders make their moves. A couple percentage points of market share gained during a slowdown can pay huge dividends when the cycle turns around.Get closer to your customers in order to offer them products and services that best serve their needs, Salter advises. When things are bad for the owner, it may be worse for the customer. So you must find creative ways to engage customers at a new level; understand their interests and help them solve life problems.Do More with LessSmall-business owners should become experts at survival tactics, Salter notes. If you have to lay off employees, then keep the best, train them more, and pay them more to do more. The customer experience cannot suffer because the owner has fewer resources.Scaling back before youve lost too much is critical, Wheelwright adds. Avoid throwing good money after bad. Business owners tend to try too hard and too long to keep employees and the business running as it was. Instead, regroup and look at how to ride out the storm. Laying off some longtime employees is better than going bankrupt, which doesnt help anyone.Shave TaxesRather than inventory or employees, taxes may be the single biggest cost to a small business, Wheelwright notes. We pay so much attention to production and employees that we often forget taxes are taking 50percent or more of the net income from most small businesses. A simple plan of action from a good tax advisor can reduce taxes by 10 to 40 percent in a very short period of time. The extra cash flow from reduced taxes can be used for marketing, expansion and a well-deserved vacation for the owner.Maximizethe HighsWhen the good times come, and they will, use those opportunities to prepare for the long haul and focus on growing your business. Be strategic and proactive and use the wave to look for ways to reduce expenses and increase profit margins, says business optimization strategist Darnyelle Jervey, CEO of Incredible One Enterprises. By running your business a minimum of 90 days ahead strategically, youll likely be proactive versus reactive to unseen circumstances.Whatever you do, dont convince yourself that the boon is here to stay and spend all your cash. All small businesses should maintain a cash reserve of three to six months of expenses at all times, Wheelwright says. A strong line of credit can also take the pressure off when the business has its downs.Be StraightforwardDont deceive your employees, especially when times are difficult, Panaggio says. Employees are perceptive. Communicate the state of the company on a regular basis. When advised and included in the process of implementing change during down markets, employees become understanding and helpful. In the same respect, when things are good, reward them. Then theyll stand by you and work extra hard through any market fluctuations.For more tips on how to help ease your way through tax season, access our exclusive guide, Its Tax Time: A Business Owners Survival Guide.Read more articles about financial analysis.The information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

What will happen to your business after you're gone?

He has been interviewed over 500 times in national and international media, including NBC, Univision and CNN.The founders of family-owned businesses that have built valuable companies face a tremendous challenge when it comes to estate planning: how to transfer ownership to their children. There are two hurdles to overcome: taxes and uncertainty.Taxes...The taxes take the form of gift and estate taxes.The IRS taxes any transfer of value when nothing or something of lesser value is received in exchange. If the transfer happens during your lifetime its subject to a gift tax; if it happens after you die, its subject to the estate tax.It is your responsibility to keep track of the cumulative value of all gifts made during your life, and is especially important to your estate planning. For 2016 the first $5.45 million of transfers are gift and estate tax free. Any amount over that is taxed at an astounding 40 percent rate to be paid by the estate. The IRS does allow up to $14,000 per year to be given to a recipient without having it count towards that lifetime limit. There is no limit to the number of people that you can give $14,000 to each year. But it can be a critical problem if you have a company that is worth significantly more than the exemption.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Mike Periu"" alignment=""center""]With a GRAT, a small-business owner can basically remove a portion of the value of their ownership stake in the company from their taxable estate and give it tax free to their children.[/pullquote]Lets say your company is worth $10 million at your death. Assuming you have the maximum $5.45 million exemption available, your estate would still owe $1.82 million in estate tax. The IRS only accepts cash and the payment is due in full nine months after you die. If neither the estate nor the heirs have the cash available, then it may require a forced sale of the business at a discount price, borrowing money at exorbitant rates or some other unpleasantdecision just to pay the tax....and UncertaintyUncertainty is tied to legislative risk.The general perception is that only the extremely wealthy pay gift and estate taxes.According to a 2015reportby the Joint Committee on Taxation, out of nearly 2.6 million deaths that occurred in 2013, only 4,687 were subject to the estate tax.This perception turns the estate taxalso called the death taxinto political fodder. Many prominent politicians and even some of the wealthiest people in the country believe that the estate tax should be 100 percent! Even if the rate doesnt increase, the exemption amount could be reduced from $5.54 million to just $1 million or even less.ATool at Your DisposalThere is an entire industry of estate planning lawyers and accountants who look for ways to minimize gift and estate taxes for their clients. Many of the strategies they employ are cost prohibitive and only make sense for people with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal. There are however some tools that are not cost prohibitive that can help.One tool is the Grantor Retained Annuity Trust, commonly called a GRAT. With a GRAT, a small-business owner can basically remove a portion of the value of their ownership stake in the company from their taxable estate and give it tax-free to their children. To show how a GRAT works, lets use an example of how to set one up and then discuss the benefits.John, a business owner nearing retirement, hires an independent third party to value his company. Its worth $5 million. He recapitalizes the company into 100 shares, one with voting rights and 99 non-voting shares. John then establishes a trust with several characteristics. First, it is a grantor trust, meaning it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes. Any income taxes owed will be Johns responsibility.Second, the trust is irrevocable, meaning that during the life of the trust, John cant just change his mind about it. John names his children as the beneficiaries of the trust. John will also be responsible for managing the trust. Third, the trust will have a defined term, usually a short period of time like two years. At the end of that period, the trust ceases to exist. John will then contribute the 99 non-voting shares worth $4.95 millionto the trust as the only asset.Here comes the interesting part. The trust will issue John annuity payments on a regular basis. The sum of the payments will be equal to 100 percent of the value of the 99 shares today ($4.95million)plus interest. This setup is known as a zeroed out GRAT because the grantor gets all of their money back. The interest rate is provided by the IRS and is known as the 7520 interest rate.Lets fast forward two years. During this time the business has increased significantly in value. The original 99 shares are now worth $100,000 each, or $9.9 million in total. The trust was required to pay John $4,950,000 plus $69,300 in interest for a total of $5,019,300. That leaves an additional $4,880,700 in value. That istransferred to the beneficiariesJohns childrenwithout any tax consequences and avoiding up to $1.95 million in additional estate taxes.With this structure John has successfully kept nearly $4.9 million of assets out of his taxable estate. He achieved the goal of transferring this wealth to his children but still retains control of the business.At the end of the trusts life, a new trust could be set up, rolling over the assets into the new trust to transfer additional value to his children. The reason you structure this as short-lived trusts is because if John dies during the term of the trust, then the tax benefits are lost. Its less risky to have multiple short-term GRATs than one GRAT that lasts for a decade.The cost of setting up an initial GRAT is usually just a few thousand dollars in legal fees with recurring GRATs costing less.As with all legal matters, its best to consult your attorney before making a decision regarding the applicability of a GRAT for your particular estate planning needs.For more tips on how to help ease your way through tax season, access our exclusive guide, Its Tax Time: A Business Owners Survival Guide.Read more articles on taxes.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Purchasing an existing company is a possible strategy for growing your business. But you may want to ask yourself a few questions before making the leap.,2016-10-25T17:30:19+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Business Expansion, Business Plan, Competitive Research, Growth Opportunities, Market Research, Planning for Growth]",Planning for Growth,Rieva Lesonsky,"Growing Your Business: 7 Questions to Ask Before You Buy a CompanyRieva LesonskyContributing Writer, SmallBizTrends.comI am a small business & entrepreneurship thought leader, advocate and journalist. My mission is to help people start and grow their own businesses, which Ive been doing for over 30 years.My company, GrowBiz Media is a custom content creation company focusing on small business and entrepreneurship. We create content for small business websites and major marketers wanting to connect to entrepreneurs. We also own the small business blog, www.SmallBizDaily.com.Buying another company can be a smart shortcut to growing your business. Or it can be a quagmire you quickly regret. Is buying a business the right option to help your business grow? Consider asking yourself these seven questions before you decide.1. What do I want to achieve by buying another business?Purchasing a second business can serve many purposes in growing your company.You can buy a company that sells a product or service your current company needs. This can ultimately save you money since you wont have to deal with outside vendors anymore.You can buy a similar business in a different geographic area in order to quickly expand to a new marketplace. For example, if you own a pizza restaurant, you might buy another pizza restaurant in a nearby town and rebrand it.You can buy a complementary business that enables you to expand your product or service offerings. If you own a spa, you might buy a hair or nail salon. If you own an e-commerce website, you might buy a brick-and-mortar retail store.If you find a business that seems like a natural fit in any of these ways, buying it could be a good option for growing your business.2. How stable is my existing business?If you purchase a second business, dealing with the acquisition and integration of the new company into your own can take up most of your time for the foreseeable future.At the same time, until your new purchase gets up to speed, you may need to rely on the income from your original business to support both operations. Having an existing business that runslike a well-oiled machine can help youget through this transition phase smoothly.3. Do I have the appropriate management skills and a strong team?Integrating an existing company requires a particular set of management and leadership skills. After all, an existing company will probably have its own culture, its own ways of doing things and employees who will be understandably wary of change.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Rieva Lesonsky"" alignment=""center""]Carefully weigh whether purchasing an existing company as a means of growing your business can helpsave you time, money and headaches compared to other growth options. [/pullquote]If you lack these skills yourself, you may want to have a second-in-command. They can help take charge of integrating the two organizations and execute the transition.4. How familiar am I with the industry?Growing your business through acquiring a new business isnt as cut and dry as one would think. Purchasing a business in a different industryfor example, purchasing one of your vendorscan be especially challenging if you arent familiar with the ins and outs of that industry.You may have to rely on existing management at the company youre purchasing to stay in place and help manage the transition. You may need to pay them more to stay on board, or else hire outside managers to come in and take charge. Both options can be expensive, so be sure to build these costs into the price of any purchase you are considering.5. Can I realistically obtain financing for this purchase?Getting a loan for growing your business can be simpler than getting startup financing, but that still doesnt mean its easy.You may want to assess all of your options. Can you finance the purchase out of your own profits? Do you have strong relationships with banks or other lenders? Another option could be seller financing, in which you make payments over time to the seller (somewhat like paying a mortgage) until the purchase is paid off with interest.6. How quickly will the purchase pay off?In some cases, buying an existing business to merge with your own can pay off right away. For example, if you purchase one of your vendors, you may see savings quickly.But in other instances, it can take months or even years for the two companies to mesh. During that time, the second business probably wont be as profitable as it once was, and the first one may suffer as well. Also consider what would happen if the purchase doesnt work outfor example, if all the employees of the new company end up jumping ship and you have to essentially start from scratch. Could you afford that type of loss?7. Are there other options that would work just as well, or better, for growing your business?Carefully weigh whether purchasing an existing company as a means of growing your business can helpsave you time, money and headaches compared to other growth options. Will buying a company be more beneficial than launching a new division, opening a second location from scratch or starting a joint venture with another business?Consider talking to your accountant, attorney and other advisors to work out the logistics and financials involved in each option youre considering.Sometimes, especially if the opportunity to buy a company arises unexpectedly, a business owner can get caught up in the excitement of the offer and make a rash decision. Try not to rush into purchasing a business. Its better to make the decision with your headand not just your heart.Read more articles on business expansion.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

They are the end result of using big data, business intelligence and analytics. KPIs can be broken down into customer-centric and operations-centric.Customer-centric KPIs usually involve transactions with data captured by point of sale systems and traffic counting systems. Operations-centric KPIs usually deal with elements of your business that dont directly touch the customer, like inventory management.The RecommendationsBefore you start working with KPIs, consider these suggestions:Take a focused approach.Analysis paralysis can be a common problem for first time users of big data. Theres so much information, which can lead to hundreds or even thousands of opportunities to improve your business, that some may get stuck not knowing where to start. Thats why it may be best to take a focused approach. Select one specific KPI to improve. An example might be conversion rate during weekends. Focus on ways to convert more browsers into buyers for Saturday and Sunday. By making it specific, you can measure results clearly and conduct experiments to determine if your ideas work.User experience is key. There are many software solutions available that produce KPIs. Itmay prove critical tochoose a user-friendly system appropriate for the scale of your business. If you need a data scientist to interpret the charts and graphs developed by a certain software solution, this solution probably isnt for you (unless you happen to be a data scientist). Owners and employees both need to feel comfortable reading and interpreting the data presented. If not, the KPIs may quickly be ignored.Provide incentives to employees.

"For three generations, Grado Labs has been run from a nondescript four-story building in Brooklyn. But by diversifying and keeping up with current trends, they've managed to stay relevantâ€”and thrive.",2016-10-20T20:30:07+00:00,Getting Customers,Customer Relations,"[Building Your Team, Company Culture, Customer Engagement, Customer Relations, Employee Retention, Facebook, Getting Customers, Industry Trends, Product Development, Social Media Strategy, Card Member Spotlight]",Getting Customers,Cara Cannella,"Easy Listening: How Grado Labs Built a Family-Run Headphones EmpireCara CannellaWriter & Editor, caracannella.comBehind an unmarked gray door covered in graffiti, the Brooklyn-based Grado family runs Grado Labs, manufacturing headphones and phono cartridges beloved by a cult following of audiophiles and musicians worldwide. With an advertising budget of zero and sales fueled by word of mouth, the company has earned top ratings from Consumer Reports and ranked among Mashables top 8 Most Social Small Businesses.Grado Labs was founded in 1953 by Joseph Grado, who hand-manufactured audio equipment in the same four-story building where his father once operated a fruit storeand where the company still operates. Joseph passed away in 2015, and Grado Labs is now run by his nephew John Grado and his great-nephew Jonathan. Johns wife, Loretta, and his younger son, Matthew, also contribute to the family business.John Grado, president and CEO of Grado LabsThe father-and-son team of John and Jonathan oversee about twenty employees led by a pair of sisters who have run Grado Labs production since 1994. Some who report to the familys townhouse for work wear magnified glasses for detailed labor with fine tools, while others operate a plastic injection-molding machine. In upstate New York, about ten more work for a family friend, to whom the Grados outsource labor for their products wood (mostly African mahogany) and metal components.Several members of the diverse Brooklyn team, drawn mostly from the surrounding neighborhood of Sunset Park, have seen 25-year-old Jonathannow vice president of marketinggrow up. ""They measured my [changing] height with pieces of tape on the wall,"" he says, seated in Grado Labs top-floor listening room, cloaked in dark blue walls and plush carpet. ""I grew up on this floor and would walk downstairs to talk to everyone. Sometimes I smashed things together, thinking I was helping, but mostly I watched them build. Theyre a second family, really.""Jonathan Grado, Grado Labs vice president of marketingHis father, John, grew up in the same space, eating cookies at the table and observing his uncle create inventions would earn him nearly 50 patents and induction into the Audio Hall of Fame in 1982. ""I came into the business at 12 years old because I wanted to make some extra money to bring my girlfriend to the movies,"" John says. ""After college, I came in and took over daily operations. That was in the mid-to-late 70s, before computers. Im a numbers buff, so I had it all figured out.""In 1990, John, now president and CEO, bought the business from his uncle, who stayed on as product designer and consultant. John had seen demand for his uncles turntable needles fall off in the late 1970s, when compact discs entered the market. By the mid-80s, he knew that Grado Labs had to diversify to stay in business. Given the overall low quality of headphones back then, he thought the company could make an impression in what was still a small market. In the early 90s, seeing that every student would one day have a laptop and need headphones, he pivoted the company in that direction. From that point on, Grado Labs saw steady growth until the early twenty-first century, when Apple introduced the iPod.In business since 1953, Grado Labs manufactures headphones and phono cartridges.""Thats when the rocket really took off. Today everyone is in the headphone market. We get notices from China all the time offering to build our headphones,"" John says. ""Our main concern is quality. You see the building here. This is who we are. We compete against billion-dollar companies with 500,000 square feet of production space. We only worry about quality of sound. Others care about moving a commodity.""Now Grado Labs sells roughly 250,000 headphones and 70,000 phono cartridges annually. With just three generations of major product updates since 1991, Grado headphones range from $79 for the SR60 to $1,700 for the Professional Series 1000. While theyve entered the in-ear headphone market, they sell mostly over-the-ear styles through their online store, 400 dealers in the United States, and distributors in 68 countries, purposely avoiding big-box stores.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]We compete against billion-dollar companies with 500,000 square feet of production space. We only worry about quality of sound. Others care about moving a commodity.John Grado, president and CEO, Grado Labs[/pullquote]The ""Grado sound,"" as known among industry insiders for its warmth and clarity, is due to their headphones open design, says John. Its speakers diaphragms, which move the air that creates the music, can move freely back and forth, he explains. ""Weve always been known for [highlighting] a very lovely midrange,"" he says, ""which accounts for probably 85 percent of music."" Many mass-market headphones have a closed or sealed design, he says, creating pressure when the diaphragm moves, and more emphasis on the heavy bass range of music. His own hearing ability was developed through decades of training with his uncle, widely known within the industry as ""Golden Ears.""After 63 years in business, the Grados know what works, but they also love to play around with new wood and various types of leather in collaborating with other brands. In 2013, a whiskey company asked them to create limited-edition headphones using wood from their white oak whiskey barrels. The same year, Grado Labs sourced wood from a neighboring Brooklyn maple tree that had fallen in a storm. Creating as many headphones as the tree would yield, theyve sold about 1,000 pairs of the GH1 [Grado Heritage One] model. With nearly 5,000 orders within a week of release, they had to cap the quantity buyers could order.The companys founder, Joseph Grado, was Johns uncle and Jonathans great uncle.Meeting demand for products with such a lean staff proves to be an ongoing challenge, John says, ""But the crew almost always surprises me at what they can turn out. When the holiday season gets crazy, I give them carte blanche: Do you want to work 24/7? Sometimes we have a three or four-month backorder, but they get it done.""Jonathan describes a few collaborations currently in the works as ""fun experiments"" that make for good stories, and those narratives help to engage the companys active social media following. With roughly 70,000 organic Facebook followersa high number for a company of Grado Labs sizeJonathan loves to keep the conversation going with longtime fans, ensuring that they still feel part of the family. On Instagram, he gets to showcase his love of photography, styling and shooting most product shots appearing there.Over the years, Grado Labs has developed a cult following with audiophiles.""I get to enjoy my hobby and do work at the same time,"" he says, recalling the early days of building Grado Labs social media presence. As an undergraduate graphic design major, he had to beef up his work experience for a mandatory resume review. He asked his dad if he could include ""Director of Social Media"" for Grado Labs. At that point, the company had no social presence, so John said, ""Only if you do it."" Jonathan said, ""Fine,"" created their Twitter and Facebook, and it snowballed.""Growing up, none of my friends knew about us,"" Jonathan says. ""Since we dont advertise, you had to be an audiophile to know about us. When I made social accounts, it gave people who knew us a place to gather.""Thanks to Jonathans marketing efforts, the company has developed a large number of social media followers.Despite Grado Labs global reach into the highest echelons of the audio world, John and Jonathan often feel like theyre operating in their own little world, and in some ways, they still are. Through the intimacy of their signature sound and a strong, connected following, everyone is still invited into their living room.Photos: Christopher Lane",Easy Listening: How Grado Labs Built a Family-Run Headphones Empire
John Shi and Woody Hines have taken their love for their alma matters and turned it into a careerâ€”Hillflint's chic collegiate knits are proving a big success with university retailers and beyond.,2016-10-04T21:30:52+00:00,Planning for Growth,Research,"[Industry Trends, Planning for Growth, Product Development, Research, Strategy, Card Member Spotlight]",Planning for Growth,Anthonia Akitunde,"A Better College Sweater: How Hillflint Is Disrupting the College Apparel IndustryAnthonia AkitundeFounder, mater meaAnthonia Akitunde is the founder of mater meawww.matermea.coma website that celebrates Black women at the intersection of career and family.Inside of a co-working space in New Yorks Financial District, John Shi and Woody Hines are focused on bringing Hillflinttheir line of chic collegiate knitsto students and alumni who still love repping their alma maters. And their hard work is paying off; Hillflints growth has ballooned impressively since its 2013 launch. According to Shi and Hines, the company went from partnering with just one university (Dartmouth, Shis alma mater) to 90 schools, and is now stocked in more than 25 retailers. And just how are the duo handling that impressive growth?Coffee,"" Shi says, laughing.Coffee and focus,"" Hines agrees.Its a formula Shi and Hines have followed long before Hillflints most recent growth spurt. The pair met in 2011 as rising seniors during a summer internship at a hedge fund. Hines sent out an email promoting an Indiegogo campaign he was launching for his mens style blog, Men of Habit, to the firms listserv.That email was probably not the [wisest] thing to send to a really smart group of 1,300 people,"" Hines admits. But it at least caught Johns attention.""The two kept in touch after their internships and graduations. As they went out into the worldShi worked at Amazon for under a year, Hines explored marketing and brandingtheir minds were still on college. Specifically, college wear.A model in one of Hillflints collegiate sweaters.One thing we both noticed, as students and alumni who are really proud of our schools, is that the apparel in our bookstores is kind of boring,"" Shi explains of the typical T-shirts and hoodies screenprinted with college logos bought on campus. Its all the same stuff, made by the same companies. And it didnt quite live up to how we felt about our experiences in college. That was the initial impetus behind coming out with better college apparel in the form of really high-quality, stylish stuff that didnt exist in the market.""Shi and Hines envisioned a classic sweater that channeled the knits Ivy Leaguers have favored since the turn of the century. In 2013, they began working on Hillflint part time and remotely, from opposite sides of the country. Shi and Hines knew they had a viable business on their hands when a third of Shis graduating class pre-ordered a sweater during homecoming. And after posting similar numbers when they expanded to Princeton, Hines alma mater, they used KickStarter to raise capital in the fall of 2013.We were like, How do we test the concept quickly, and get cash in the door immediately?""

They moved into an affordable house on a crummy block to cut down on overheadWe were in a less desirable area of that less desirable area,"" Hines saysand devoted their time to getting Hillflint in schools beyond their alma maters.But doing that would require upending business as usual in the collegiate wear industry.A lot of this industry hinges around lower-end distribution,"" Hines explains. The collegiate market for apparel is many billions of dollars, and just Walmart alone accounts for a significant percentage of that business. The big win in this industry has historically been winning the deal with Walmart to do all of their collegiate T-shirts. We make a quality product and sell it through a better distribution channel, which is a sort of a novel concept for this industry.""It also meant showing both wholesalers and colleges that students wanted more than heathered T-shirts and hoodies.Essentially you have to create a unique product and show that it has potential in the market,"" Hines says. And then the school has to be onboard with it. So its a really challenging process. We started with a few select schools, and that was kind of our way to claw further and further up the food chain to the point where we could be partnering with schools with very developed retail programs.""Hillflints growthfrom less than 20 schools in 2014 to around 90 todaytook a lot longer than it would appear, Shi and Hines say.A lot of these are really, really slow-play pitches,"" Shi says. I reached out to [one university] bookstore in the spring of 2013. They placed their first order, like, over a year later. That was just being consistent, showing growth, being nice and a lot of persistence. Now this person is one of our closest retail partners. Shes actually graduated from the retail store to corporate headquarters at this retailer, and now we have a great relationship with her buying team that spans multiple schools.""We started to have that retailer interest that we could then show to all the schools and then very rapidly expand,"" Hines says. It was nice to have those national partners who wanted to stock us in a ton of schools. That made the product more enticing.""With each new milestone, the duo moves further up that collegiate wear foodchain. They eventually left Indianapolis for San Francisco (to be closer to an e-commerce partner), and moved to New York this summer. Now theyre on the hunt for their second employee, and are planning to launch products beyond their sweaters. If Shi and Hines have their way, Hillflints aesthetic and quality sportswear will be available to those who want to show their school spirit all year long.For more insights on expanding your business, access our exclusive guide by Drybar founder and chief creative officer Alli Webb, Disrupt & Grow: How Drybar Became a $50M Business.Photos from top: iStock, Courtesy of Hillflint",A Better College Sweater: How Hillflint Is Disrupting the College Apparel Industry

His website is timberry.com. His blogging is collected at blog.timberry.com. He advocates lean business planning at leanplan.comLong before going viral"" meant spreading or growing fast online, business forecasters were borrowing formulas from epidemiologythe study of how diseases spreadto project the reach of a new product through a population. This became part of contagion theory, which dates back to French social psychologistGustave Le Bon in his book called The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mindpublishedin 1895. The concept is simple: People spread ideas like germs spread disease, and the math is similar. If 100 people each convince (or infect) one other person per month, then that makes 200 people after the first month, 400 after the second and so forth.(I learned about the underlying math of contagion theory at Stanford Business School from Professor James March, who also covers it in his book An Introduction to Models in the Social Sciences.)How Contagion Theory WorksAccording to contagion theory, as the population becomes more infected, the contagion factor slows down. So in a population of 10,000, its only 199 instead of 200 after the second month, and its only 394 instead of 400 in the second. Thats because the math changes as the population is infected, so the likelihood of each person infecting others goes down. By the time half the population is half infected, it takes two infected people to infect one new one.Contagion theory has been used for years tohelp business owners forecast new products and trends. There are several assumptions involved. (You can see those numbers in the illustration below, with a simple business spreadsheet.)The total potential market in this case is 10,000 people. This is an estimate, based on educated guessing. Try to estimate the equivalent for your new product or line of business. Maybe youre a restaurant and youre dealing with the reachable population of your local area plus tourists. Maybe youre planning a product that might be used by ophthalmologists or Subaru owners or left-handed golfers. You know your industry, so you know where to find estimates for total reachable market. Dont sweat the details. This is all educated guessing.The contagion estimate shows up here in cell B8, as a simple 1.0. Thats guesswork. As business owners, we might not be able to afford to do the research to really know this number. Ive always used trial and error with this factor, filling numbers into the spreadsheet and deciding what looks realistic. I look at the line charts my model generates (which youll see below) and try different values until I believe its a useful estimate. In this case, for illustration purposes, I used a value of 1.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Tim Berry"" alignment=""center""]What customers say about my business is important. The rate at which my customers recommend me to others is essentially the contagion factor.[/pullquote]Row 2 shows total users at the beginning of each month. Row 3 shows new users convinced during the month. Row 4 shows total users at the end of the month. That is the sum of the beginning-of-month users plus new users. Row 5 shows the remaining non users at the end of the month. For this illustration, I assumed a launch event generated 100 initial users in the first month. From the second month on, all new users are from contagion.The likelihood of a new user, shown in yellow, goes down over time as more people are already users and fewer are still around waiting to be convinced. So that number is 99 percent in the beginning when almost all of the population is untouched, but it goes down to 7.65 percent by October when most people are already users.The row in green at the bottom shows total market penetration.You can see the main contagion formula inthe spreadsheet above. In cell C3, the spreadsheet multiplies the 100 users at the beginning of the month (in cell C2 above it) times the contagion factor in row 8 times the likelihood factor in row 7. The additional details in that formula are sophistications for spreadsheet purists. One rounds the result to whole people and the other prevents the model from going loopy when the contagion reaches the total population.Contagion IllustratedThe numbers above produce the S-curve that professional forecasters like to see as a natural phenomenon when a disease or new idea or product spreads through a population. The growth is slow in the beginning, then takes off, then slows as market penetration increases.That shows here in the line chart I drew from row 4 above.These same numbers can also show how sales can shoot up as a new product or idea penetrates the market, then fall off to nothing as the market becomes penetrated. The image here shows row 3, new users, which is equivalent to sales.Of course the line chart above doesnt look like good news for the hypothetical business in question. Selling only one product once is not exciting when the total market is only 10,000. It does highlight the importance of repeat business and add-ons, and why business owners would wantmarkets of more than 10,000 potential buyers.Using Contagion Theory for Your BusinessI learned this technique in business school and used it professionally during the heyday of personal computers, in the 1980s, to project the spread of personal computers through various populations. It was similar with early fax technology a few decades ago, and many times over with new technologies including the web, social media, smartphonesessentially most new products. Ive seen it apply as well to non-product phenomena such as sushi, Thai food, ultimate Frisbee and even talking points in politics.What Ive found is that contagion theory helps me get comfortable with estimates. Before I introduce a new product, feature or service, Ill run a contagion model as a reality check. It can be a positive step towards moving from raw guessing to educated guessing. I ask myself and my marketing team what the total population of users might be. I want to guess how long it takes to get substantial penetration. This theoryand the math behind itcan help.In addition, I find this whole theory a good reminder of the power of contagion. What customers say about my business is important. The rate at which my customers recommend me to others is essentially the contagion factor. The more, the better. Im always looking for ways to make the contagion go faster.Read more articles on research.Photos: iStock, Tim BerryThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Im Senior Partner at FortuneCookieAdvertising.com and Im based in Greater New York City Area.After starting a number of businesses, I have learned the importance of always putting thecustomers interests first. On the surface, this may seemobvious, something almost every business owner would claim to agree with. However, I have to admit that I was initially far more interested in acquiring new customers than providing the best possible service to existing ones.Its not that I was indifferent to my customers; I did my best to serve them and live up to my obligations. But I did not make this a priority, whichactually slowed my growth in the beginning and even contributed to some early failures. With this in mind, hereare the two leadingways I have learned to put customers first.Personalize YourCustomer ServiceYou may have noticed how hard it can be sometimes to reach customer support at a large company, such as an airline, phone or cable company. The company might redirect you toFAQs and make it difficult to find actual contact information. One simple way that small to mid-sized businesses might make themselves more appealing to consumers is to provide more personal support and customer service. Yet not all of them dothis.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]If theres any customer confusion or dissatisfaction, I want to make sure its dealt with in a way that shows we care. And if its a serious matter, I try to handle it personally.[/pullquote]In my earlier business ventures, I provided what I thought was decent customer service, but I didnt exactly make it a priority. There was a support ticket system and someone in charge of answering questions. Most questions were politely but tersely answered with links to information on the website. If there was an urgent matter, such as a service not received or a refund request, it was handled efficiently. However, there was little personal contact.Now I train team members to handle customer support in a much more engaging manner. If its a very basic question (e.g., how do I find your order page?), it can obviously be answered with a quick link. However, if theres any customer confusion or dissatisfaction, I want to make sure its dealt with in a way that shows we care. And if its a serious matter, I try to handle it personally.The importance of this was driven home to me not long ago, when I spent about 15minutes talking to a customer on the phone over a fairly minor issue. I took the time to explain things and didnt simply refer to the website. A couple of weeks later, this customer not only thanked me for my help, but upgraded to another, costlier service.Make Changes Based on Customer FeedbackEmbracing change is another principle thats often more easily said than done. In truth, one of the most common reasons a business ownermakes changes is probably to increase profits. For example, if I see that a certain advertisement isnt producing the results I want, Ill make changes to the ad or try a different advertising platform. Butits often equally important to be willing to change based on what your current customers want.To do this, it may help to first be aware of what your customers are thinking. Somewill go out of their way to tell you, but most often you must request this information. Thats why it may be helpful to ask questions and conduct surveys on your website and social media pages.A good rule of thumb to consider is that every product or service you deliver is for the benefit and convenience of your customers, not you. Case in point:I once had a summer job at a popular ice cream store, where I heard numerous complaints that the store closed too early on weekends. I passed this on to the owner, but he didnt want to pay employees for any extra hours, even though it would have been a net profit for him. He had a fixed idea of how many hours he wanted the store to be open. This was a business owner who was thinking of his own short-term interests rather than those of his customers, which isnt usuallya healthy sign.A couple of years ago, I started using a mobile app that I thought would be a great way to spread the word about my business. Having learned the importance of keeping customers happy, I polled people about how they liked it. It turned out that customers found the app tedious to install and use. Although I faced some initial resistance, I decided to scrap the app to keep my customers happy.Together, these two principleseasy to endorse, but harder to act onmay have a major impact on your business.Shawn Porat is the CEO ofFortune Cookie Advertising, which sellsadvertising space in fortune cookies at Chinese restaurants throughout the United States.He is also a member of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC).For more insights on expanding your business, access our exclusive guide by Drybar founder and chief creative officer Alli Webb, Disrupt & Grow: How Drybar Became a $50M Business.Read more articles about customer service.A version of this article was originally published on October 14, 2015.

Weve worked to dispel this image and educate both the veteran and the potential hiring official about the leadership, accountability, presentation and hard work ethic that truly characterize the veteran worker. As a CEO, Ive watched veterans inspire and motivate teams in our workplace using leadership skills they learned in the military.If you want to hire veterans at your company, here are some tips to consider:Create detailed job descriptions, and consider using military language when doing so. Be clear about the job responsibilities youre seeking.Consider all types of hiring options, including part-time and full-time work, apprenticeships and intern work.Familiarize yourself with military occupational skills that might correlate with the job youre seeking to fill.Ask applicants to share their military story, if possible, during interviews, so you can determine where their developed skills and experience would best fit in your company.Find qualified applicants. Cragg suggests looking for veterans at your nearest Veteran Affairs facility, as well as local government veterans affairs offices. In hiring, he works in conjunction with L.A. mayor Eric Garcettis Office of Veteran Affairs.The Path of EntrepreneurshipMany veterans also return from duty and open their own business. This maywork out well because of their dedication and work ethic, saysCragg, who coordinated the Veteran Small Business Conference at the Bob Hope Patriotic Hall in Los Angeles, which attracted350 veteransmore than double the number of attendees heexpected.Veterans are likely to start their own businesses, probably due to a combination of learned leadership, a sense of community duty and a calculated risk-taking skill set, Cragg says.If youre a veteran interested in entrepreneurship, consider keeping the following steps in mind:Seek guidance. A number of organizations exist to help veterans start their own businesses, including the SBA-sponsoredBoots to Business. Other agencies, such asGreen Vets Los Angeles,list resources.Review financing options. Specialized funding, including SBA loans, may be available to veterans.Consider government contracting work. As a veteran, it maymake sense to consider government funded work, as Uncle Sam can seek to fill a substantial amount of contracts using small-business owners.Look to your passions.

After all, if it were easy, everyone would be successful. But there are steps you can take to help youcapitalize on important opportunities.1. Be ready.Whether youre contemplating a new product launch or simply want to be poised to pounce on any opportunity that comes your way, being prepared is important.

Sometimes being second to market in a new category can give you the advantage of a growing audience. It may also help you avoid the pitfalls the first guy discovered.Refining and polishing as you come into the market second may give you the chance to be the better provider.3. Make some noise.In Sun Tzus The Art of War, he wrote, The good warriors staging of an attack is like the bending of the crossbow full of momentum and potential.When youre trying to time your entry into a new category, you cant simply throw your product or service out into the ether and expect it to develop a following. The momentum and potential you create ahead of your launch can helpcarry your venture to success and improve your market timing. It also helps totake the time necessary to build up existing customers expectations. Learn about how your new product may bring in entirely new customers and get to know a little about them. If you sit back and wait for customers to come to you, you maybe disappointed.4. Do your homework.Sun Tzu continues, writing, When he releases the trigger, the arrow flies with a precise calculation combining distance, timing and target. Not too early, not too late.

Keeping profitability in mind can help you know when to get out of a market.Timing is important, and figuring out market timing can be tricky, theres no doubt about it.

For instance, if you wish to expand the business and get work in a particular industry, hire a CEO who is well-versed in that particular industry, which brings those contacts and skills to your business.A new CEO can also inject fire into a business and engage employees who may have become lackluster. Alternate leadership can be objective about what isnt working in the business, including employees, and use that insight to make changes that are good for the company.Steps to Choosing a CEOVanderbloemen suggeststhe first step to choosing the ideal CEO for your small business should be to consult with a board or trusted group of business advisors about the timeline as to when you want to hire someone and the proposed compensation structure.Without a goal of when the organization wants the CEO on board, its easy for small-business owners to procrastinate or keep pushing the decision down on the priority list, he says.Vanderbloemen also recommendsseeking outside assistance with the hiring process. A transition from owner to CEO can be heated and emotional, and outside expertise like an executive search firm can help keep everyone on the right track toward a unified vision, he says. The board and small-business owner should also share the proposed timeline for hiring with key stakeholders and staff.A professional executive recruiter maybe a good resource forchoosing the best candidates, adds Lane Campbell, co-founder and CEO of June. A key aspect of the hiring process is identifying what you want in the new CEO, Campbell says. Consider the responsibilities for the job and the characteristics that the new hire should possess.Challenges to Handing over the ReinsNot surprisingly, the biggest challenge associated with hiring a CEO may be letting go of control.Its human nature to resist change, but the small-business owner must be intentional about trusting the new leader once he or she is on board, Vanderbloemen says. Let go of the way youve always done things and be open to changes the new leader will bring. This might mean a shift in vision or even some staff turnover. Change is never easy, but your team will be watching you to see how you react to it.It may help to keep in mind that the CEO sets the vision now, not you, Campbell notes. If you truly want to set the vision, consider hiring a COO to run the day-to-day aspects of the business and you remain the CEO.Policy changes are likely with a new CEO, and this mayalso be difficult to handle, Jain believes. New CEOs often like to change the way things are done and may even alter the hierarchy within the company, he says.Transition GraduallyTo make the changes within your company more palatable for you and your employees, Jain suggests taking a slow, measured approach to the transition.Have employees gradually begin reporting to the new CEO and remember that you wont be able to show all your policies and the ins and outs of working for your various clients to the CEO immediately, he says. There are even some aspects of the business, like financials and trade secrets, that you dont want to relinquish control of initially or perhaps ever.Read more articles about leadership skills.A version of this article was originally published on October 21, 2015.Photo: iStock",Is It Time to Hire a CEO?
"Saving money can be hard, but this CEO says it can be possible if you apply the same strategic planning to your finances as you do to your business.",2016-10-19T17:30:07+00:00,Managing Money,Cash Flow,"[Business Plan, Cash Flow, Critical Numbers, Managing Money, Saving Money]",Managing Money,John Rampton,"How I Make Saving Money Easier as an EntrepreneurJohn RamptonWriter, Entrepreneur MediaHi there, you can call me John. Im Writer at Entrepreneur Media and Im based in San Francisco Bay Area.Starting a business on a lean budget can be challenging enough to accomplish, especially when you have to stretch every available dollar to launch. Saving money and setting it aside for your personal retirement in addition to that can be a real challenge. Some may even say its impossible.According toa 2015 TD Ameritrade Survey, 61 percent of the 1,505 self-employed individuals surveyed were anxious about saving money for retirement. While 55 percent of those surveyed said they are saving for retirement, over half are behind on this goal. Sixty-nine percent say they do not have a specific savings goal in mind for retirement. The majority assume they will just keep working and relying on their savings for retirement, and counting on social security.However, I think its completely possible to save money at the same time as working as an entrepreneur because Ive been doing it for years now. Here are some tips I want to share for savingmoney for emergency funds, larger purchases and even retirement:1. Consider the 50/30/20 plan for saving money.I adhere to a 50/30/20 plan for my savings. That means that 50 percent of income goes into needs like bills and monthly expenses for both personal and business items; 30 percent goes to ""wants"" like restaurants, clothes and trips; and 20 percent goes to savings. Since I need to invest and save about 25 times my annual expenses to cover my retirement, I use this plan to make sure that Im saving enough each month to fit this percentage split.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""John Rampton"" alignment=""center""]Consider creating the same type of strategic plan that you did for your business, mapping out how you will save money and then creating a retirement fund. Then you can execute it and review it just as you do for your business.[/pullquote]Its important to reassess this plan when things change. For example, now that I have a child there are other expenses to consider that were not part of the previous budget. You may want to review this plan each year or with any new major life change, including a new job, a move, a child, etc.2. Raise your rates and add to your skill set.As an entrepreneur, carefully assessing what you are charging for your expertise,talentand knowledge comes with the territory. If there is a gap between your target savings and what you have to save, it could be that you need to raise your rates. I make sure to reassess each year and increase what I make accordingly. Unlike a job where you get a raise, none of your clients are going to volunteer to pay you more. You should let them know.Ive looked for ways to take on additional work that pays more and to outsource a lot of the work that takes up time, but that doesnt pay as well. And, Ive also taken classes to add to my skill set and make myself more marketable to increase what I make to fill in that savings gap.3. Make financial moves.The next step to consider is to take money each month that is earmarked for savings and move it out of sight so its out of mind, too. I opt to have a set amount automatically transferred to a separate account each month. This money is then divided up for regular savings, the emergencyfundand retirement. With the birth of my daughter, part of that now also goes to a college fund.I have also set up another account for things like trips, gifts and other wants because I prefer to pay cash for these. This is only about three percent of my income each month.Once I put money in these places, I then allocate some each year to various accounts that are aimed at retirement. This includes contributing to a Roth IRA, which will allow me to withdraw money tax-free when Im retired. However, there is also the option to have a traditional IRA, which provides an income tax deduction right now.Ive just started the Solo 401(k), which is a traditional 401(k) plan that allows me to do deferrals of up to 100 percent of earned income up to a maximum of $18,000 (this amount can change every couple of years or so). There are many other options to choose from as well, especially now that there is much more flexibility in retirement plans. Research whats out there and find one that fits your situation. If you are not sure, consider seeking the advice of a financial planner who can help you find a plan that works best for you.4. Put passion into it.As an entrepreneur, its easy to be passionate about your business. After all, I put everything I have into what I do. However, when so much goes into a business, you tend to forget about everything else. The best thing you can do is put that same passion into saving money and planning for the future, in addition to the future of your business.Consider creating the same type of strategic plan that you did for your business, mapping out how you will save money and then creating a retirement fund. Then you can execute it and review it just as you do for your business. You may find that you can be on the right track with your savings and retirement while still tackling your entrepreneurial role.John Ramptonis the founder of Palo Alto, California-basedDue, afree paymentscompany specializing in helping businesses bill their clients easily online.

Mishandling your finances could spell big problems for your business. Here are a few tips on how you can help save a lot by saving a little. ,2016-10-13T20:00:00+00:00,Managing Money,Cash Flow,"[Accounts Receivable/Payable, Cash Flow, Managing Money, Saving Money]",Managing Money,Meredith Wood,"How to Help Keep Your Cash Flow FlowingMeredith WoodHead of Content and Editor-in-Chief, FunderaEditor-in-Chief at Fundera, the most trusted online marketplace for small business loans.You could have an absolutely dynamite product or service. Your business model could be impeccable. But if you dont manage your cash correctly, you very well could fail.Clearly, to run a successful business, you need more than just a good idea. You need a solid managerial strategy. You must focus on the books. Because if you mishandle your finances, your business could be toast.One way to help improve your companys finances is to look for areas in which you are losing cash. Youll probably find that you are spending money that you simply dont have to spend. So, wise up and fix the issue. Here are five signs that your business could be bleeding cashand some advice on how to stop it.1. Management tasks are done manually.Is too much time being wasted on sending invoices, processing payroll, sorting emails and scheduling appointments? Its alarming that, according to a 2015 survey of nearly 1,000 managers in the U.S. and U.K. by ServiceNow, nearly half of managers say this type of administrative work leaves them with less time for strategic initiatives.While these duties are certainly important, they can be automated with todays technological solutions. And you and your team can spend more time on what mattersproducing a great product or service.For example, to process payments to employees, you can use payroll solutions like Intuit Online Payroll or Quickbooks Online Payroll. If you run social-media marketing campaigns, try a service like Hootsuite to schedule posts to go live across all your channels. And for scheduling meetings, try a tool like Calendly.2. Clients arent paying on time.Every startup and small business has been left waiting for payment at some point. Even if you know youll eventually get paid, this is still costing you money.While waiting for payment, you may have to get money from other sources to pay employees, fund marketing initiatives, cover rent and handle other requirements. Obtaining that money from a business line of credit or business credit card, for instance, is very possible. But this can cost you in interest (which would be totally unnecessary if the client had paid you on time).To stop this from happening, politely establish clear payment policies with each client. You could ask for a percentage up front, and the rest once the projects completed. Also, automate invoicing and reminders if the payment is late, and set a timeframe for charging a late fee. If payment is significantly late (like four weeks), you might consider stopping work until the balance is paid.3. Rent is just too much.Yes, a swanky downtown office is nice, but you dont necessarily need it. Put that cash toward other activities, like marketing and advertising campaigns.Co-working spaces can offer flexible short-term leasing plans for shared office space. You can also allow employees to work from home, which may raise productivity and workplace satisfaction all around. When your team needs to meet, you can do so virtually or in a public setting, like a cafe or library.4. Daily expenses are too high.Sure, its nice to have the newest computers for your employees. Going out to eat each Friday is cool, too. And keeping the office super clean makes you feel good. But its all probably unnecessary. Or, at the very least, you can choose much cheaper alternatives.Just think about the classic coffee example. If a cup of coffee costs $3 with tip, that runs you $15 per week for each worker if you buy outside. Make it in the office, and you can help get those costs down considerably (probably to just a few bucks per worker).Everything adds up over time, so you should try to save wherever you can. Do your best to track all your expenses and your wallet will thank you for it.5. You dont negotiate deals.If you dont at least attempt to negotiate pricing with your vendors, you are leaving money on the table. Whenever you hire outside help to provide goods or services, dont be hesitant to counteroffer. At worst, the price remains the same. At best, you save lots of money over time.Getting the price of goods or services cut down by 5 to 10 percent (or more) is not impossible. Even if you already have a contract with most of your vendors, dont hesitate to reach out and discuss rates. When negotiating a deal, dont be contentious. Be professional, and explain your business situation. Make sure to offer them something in return for cutting rates, such as a contract extension.Also, if you can, gather bids from multiple vendors when looking for help. Compare and choose the best offer for your company.Stop the bleeding and build for the future.Its tough to grow a business when you are constantly paying off debt, waiting on client payments and paying more than you should for services, products and property. Its also difficult to see how to turn your financial situation around when you dont track it.Going forward, be completely clear on where your money is coming from and going to. Then, address the pain points with prejudice. By securing your cash flow, your company wont be held back by poor money managementand you can grow and scale when the demand arises.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

If youd like to share your business story to be considered for a feature on OPEN Forum, please sign in or sign upandanswer a few short questions.A 70 percent conversation rate could make any small-business owner grin.Thats what Kyle Hogan noticed was happening when his parents sold a family recipe seasoning mix at a local farm stand. Almost everyone who smelled the salt mix bought one. Maybe, he thought, theres a business beyond a local stall.Today, Livias Holdings manufactures more then 20,000 units of Livias Seasoning Salt, and just launched in 25 grocery stores earlier this month. The key, says Hogan, who is the managing partner and director of sales, is well-balanced cash flow, a good professional spice blender and a family recipe that has lasted generations.1. Why did you start your business?My parents mixed a family recipe seasoning in their basement and sold it in jars at farmers markets in Minnesota. I attended a market to support them and saw seven out of 10 people who smelled the seasoning take money out and buy the product before even tasting it. That conversion rate inspired me to get involved and have the blend properly manufactured and marketed.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Managing the process to order more product and lead time to process once inventory runs low gets tricky. We have to carefully plan our calendar and sales events to make sure we do not have too much demand too soon.[/pullquote]2. How has your business grown?We started out in the basement mixing 100 units per batch. We moved through four levels of blenders where we now make 12,000 units per batch twice a year. We have just added a grocery distributor that placed us in a 25-location regional grocer in our home state.The product is also used as a student fundraiser for schools and youth organizations. We identified the areas of concern in existing student consumer product fundraising and altered our offer to be the most competitive and appealing fundraiser in the industry. Adding distributors and spreading the word about our fundraising opportunity will help us grow quickly.3. What has been your most memorable moment as a business owner?On a sales call in California meeting with a grocery manager who was a long time customer but had not shown much emotion or interest in our product. On this specific day, this gentleman told me that he and his wife do not cook or eat without Livias. I had no idea he even knew much about the product. This was memorable to me as it proved that patience is critical [and made me] aware that all customers need to be valued and paid attention to regardless of where you think the relationship stands with your product.4. Whats the biggest challenge you face in getting your product to market?Managing the process to order more product and lead time to process once inventory runs low gets tricky. We have to carefully plan our calendar and sales events to make sure we do not have too much demand too soon as to not lose the confidence of our customers. As a food-related product, it is key to offer samples. I have yet to solve the perfect sample size that recreates the way one would use Livias, without giving away full shakers of Livias. But I am getting close.5. Whats your favorite recipe, and why?Livias original use was for corn on the cob. My favorite recipe or use for Livias is on sliced tomatoes, crispy bacon and avocado on an open face lightly toasted piece of rye bread.Photo: iStock",Featured Member: Liviaâ€™s Seasoning's Kyle Hogan

And as the business grows, your time may be better spent in areas where you have expertise to generate increased cash flow.So, Who Will Do the Accounting Work?When it comes to determining who will take care of accounting in your business, you could either do it yourself, assign someone on your staff to do it or outsource to a bookkeeper or accountant.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Hal Shelton"" alignment=""center""]When you started your business, you were probably the chief of everything officer. Now with some cash flow, you may wantto consider what type of assistance to hire. [/pullquote]If you can afford to hire someone, great! If not, as soon as youre able to you may want to consider doing so. You started your business because you are good at selling, developing apps, consulting or whatever other activities produce sales and cash flow. It may be more valuable to spend your time producing cash flow than doing bookkeeping.If you decide to engage someone else, there are two types of financial professionals to consider: a certified public accountant (CPA) and a bookkeeper. Each has different skills and rates, which is why you may want to retain both, but for different tasks.Basic Accounting for Business OwnersAn accounting system can help you file required reports, but its really for you to help make smart decisions and track performance. Here are some tips for setting up basic accounting for your business before you hire financial professionals.Set up the system: You can use a notebook, spreadsheets or accounting software. Whatever youre comfortable with is fine; just make sure it tracks transactions, makes projections and focuses on cash. As your business grows, you may grow to have a more systemized and structured accounting system.Enter transactions: Transactions may include sales made, cost of material purchased, employee compensation and benefits, hours worked, rent, IT, insurance premiums, office supplies and other expenses paid.Report actual results and project future results: Your reports may cover the status of potential customers, sales made, sales made where customers have not yet paid, expense comparisons with the budget and same period last year, all sorts of tax reports, financial statements and information needed to satisfy bank loan covenants.What aCertified Public Accountant Can DoA certified public accountant is more than someone who is good at numbers. ACPA is certified by a state examining board after having met the states legal requirements. These professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct.Accountantslike doctors, lawyers and other professionalsare both generalists and specialists. Accounting specialties may include tax accounting, mergers & acquisitions, nonprofits, etc. In the beginning, your accountant will likely be doing mostly general accounting work. However you may want to do some searching to find the right match for your companys needs.Depending on the market and how complex your work, CPAs may charge $100 to $500 an hour.Consider hiring an accountant if you have really challenging work. It may also help if its a high-value project such as the quarterly financial reportsespecially if you are required to give these financial documents to a bank or are under a government contract.Once your company reaches several million in sales, you may want to consider hiring a full-time accountant on staff, but until then, it may be more economical to outsource.To find a CPA, considering asking for referrals. You can also check out the various accounting professional society websites.What a Bookkeeper Can DoBookkeepers can perform your companys basic day-to-day activities, such as gathering employee timesheets, submitting purchase-order invoices for you to pay and entering all the transaction information into your accounting and recordkeeping system.Once again, depending on the market and duties assigned, a bookkeeper may charge $20 to $50 an hour. Many businesses retain a part-time bookkeeper to help set up their accounting system and enter all the transactions, until the companys growth can support having someone full time. Even if you are doing the transaction processing yourself, you might want to engage a bookkeeper to help set up your accounting system with an appropriate code of accounts and pre-established report formats.To find a bookkeeper, referrals are good as well. You can ask an accountant for someone they have vetted and worked with, or look at the classified ads in your local paper.But Dont Outsource and Forget ItIf you do not have the skills, time, inclination or budget, outsourcing accounting activities can beOK. But remember, this is your company and the financial statements are yours. When you present your financial statements to a bank, file your tax return or any other such use, you will be the one signing the documents. So you will need some understanding of what is included. Consider looking over the important materials and asking for explanations if anything is unclear.Read more articles on accounting.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Erika Napoletano gets restless brands and the people brave enough to lead them UNstuck, shortening the distance between where they are and ""heck yeah."" Business columnist, award-winning author, TEDx talker, nerd in a dress.Theres scarcely a business out there that doesnt experience rushes and lulls in its cash flow. If only there were a way to make sure you had the cash you needed on-hand year-round, despite business cycles being what they are.There can be a wayby having a smart, year-round cash flow plan.This type of planning cantake multiple facets of your organization into account, including accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory management. Building strategies around each of these three business areas can help yougetahead of the competition when it comes to keeping the cash flowing year-round.Creating a Cash Flow Plan Around Accounts Payable...When to pay your vendors is always an intriguing dance when developing your cash flow plan. While you dont want to be known as the slow-to-pay customer, you do want to keep your cash on hand for as long as possible. This can mean that youll have more cash on hand year-round even when your receivables arent flowing at peak volume.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Erika Napoletano"" alignment=""center""]Consider looking for software that makes it easy for customers to pay you with a wide variety of credits cards, ACH or bank transfers.[/pullquote]So how do you strike a happy medium between being slow to pay and reliable? In a time wherebehemoths like Boeing are extending their accounts payable terms from 30 to 60 days, this may be an ideal time for your business to explore builiding flexible terms with your vendors and your cash flow plan. Here are some tips for seeking improvements:Explore discount opportunities:Consider speaking with vendors and seeing if theyre willing to extend discounts for invoices paid prior to their due date. They might be willing to help you save money if it means that money appears in their account faster.Involve multiple decision makers: The people paying your companys bills mayrarely be the people or departments making the purchase decisions. Establishing a regular collaboration between your finance team and your procurement teams may help improve purchasing habits. You can help boost your cash flow by looking at historical ordering practices and the time taken to deplete those purchases. Your financial team can help improve purchasing habits to optimize pricing and reduce any cash flow-hindering charges like rush fees and expediting shipping.... Accounts Receivable...Much like accounts payable, a smart year-round cash flow plan canmean making it easy and attractive for your customers to pay youand fast. These strategies may help you amp up your cash flow plan year round by employing ease and incentives:Use smarter accounting software: Many invoicing and accounting programs come with integrated payment systems. Consider looking for software that makes it easy for customers to pay you with a wide variety of credits cards, ACH or bank transfers. Flexibility in payment types may mean fewer excuses and delays in payments headed your way.Incentivize early payments: As with your accounts payable, you may want to extend your customers the same early-pay discount courtesy. When you institute a discount policy for early payments, sending out a broad noticevia email and regular mailcan help alert customers to your new discount policy. Notating this discount and the associated payment windows on your invoices can be helpful as well.Stand by your late fees: Credit cards and mortgage companies have standard late fees. It may be time for your company to do the same. For vendors who have trouble paying on time, consider establishing a grace period while not being shy about your late fees. When a customer is late the first time, you can call them and offer to waive the fee for immediate payment over the phone. This can help establish good will whilereinforcing that the fees exist. Theres nothing wrong with having a few more dollars in your year-end coffers from invoices that were paid lateand for being paid for the inconvenience.... and Inventory ManagementAs mentioned in accounts payable, a smart cash flow plan can include connecting and empowering communication between all the people spending money in your organization with the team managing your finances. So, where should your team begin with revamping your inventory practices for the benefit of your year-round cash flow?Intuit suggestsfour steps for businesses looking to reduce their inventory costs:havinga regular and accurate physical inventory count,liquidating your excess inventory through practices such as bundling, liquidation sales or even charitable donations,tailoring your purchasing practices to maintain more appropriate inventory levels to match sales volume,establishing reorder alerts so you know when its time to replenish. (Reorder alerts can help you avoid rush fees and customer dissatisfaction due to out-of-stocks, which can be harmful to cash flow.)For many businesses, inventory shipping out the door is how you get revenue back in the door. But you may want to make sure that your inventory methods arent inadvertently sending dollar bills outthe door with each shipment.Read more articles on managing money.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

"Forgetting overtime, misclassifying employees... These payroll mistakes might cost you your business if you don't know how to avoid them.",2016-09-20T13:30:54+00:00,Managing Money,Cash Flow,"[Accounting, Cash Flow, Critical Numbers, Employee Retention, Managing Money]",Managing Money,Geoff Williams,"3 Common Payroll Blunders That Could Hurt Your BusinessGeoff WilliamsJournalist, freelance writerfreelance journalist and authorIf you have employees and often sweat the finer details of getting their deposits or checks to them, you may havehad this thought come to you more than a few times: Someone should pay me for doing payroll.Youre forgiven for being stressed. Payroll taxes are financially and administratively the most burdensome task that a business owner has to deal with, according to the 2015 Small Business Taxation Survey from the National Small Business Association, which queried over 675 small-business owners. Payrollsunpleasant nature is one reason why so many companies have human resource departments. But even then payroll mistakes can still be made.Bryan Clayton of Nashville, Tennesseeknows from experience. Before he started GreenPal, a website where consumers can find lawn care services, he owned a regional landscape construction firm with over 125 employees.""We had a dedicated in-house payroll administrator who handled all of our payroll duties appropriately,"" Clayton says. ""Or so I thought.""But according to Clayton, a random audit by the Department of Labor in 2012 concluded thathisbusiness was paying middle managers as salaried employees instead of hourly.The auditors then informed Clayton that his company owned 27 middle managers back pay in overtime totaling over $475,000.""This was one of the worst moments in my journey of owning and operating businesses for 20 years,"" Clayton says. ""It almost sunk our company.""So if youre often pulling your hair out over your payroll, consider keeping these potential blunders in mind.1. Misclassifying EmployeesThat was the mistake Claytons companymade. He says the main sticking point the Department of Labor had was that although the middle managers oversaw the work of five to 10 employees, sometimes they were engaged in physical labor as well. That, Clayton says, made them hourly and not salaried employees.""Misclassifying employees is a huge, common problem,"" says Chase Garbarino, CEO ofVentureApp, a marketplace to help startups connect with products and services.Garbarino adds that you can also get in trouble if you misclassify part-time employees and certainly contractors.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Bryan Clayton"" alignment=""center""]A few thousand dollars in consulting fees would have saved me a half million dollars and two years of agony.Bryan Clayton, founder, GreenPal[/pullquote]""You must issue a 1099 form if you work with a vendor or contractor who provides a certain amount of hours of services to your business,"" Garbarino says.Dont forget your employee is a human being. When youre crunching numbers, in an effort to make your math work out, you might be tempted to ""forget"" to pay someone overtime. Even if your intentions are goodyou plan on paying the overtime when things are a little betterit may not be wise to go there. Youcould berunning afoul of the Fair Labor Standards Act.Onerule of thumb is to think, ""How would I feel if my boss did this to me?""That might help you, for instance, avoid deducting pay for disciplinary reasons. This might seem reasonable if an employee broke something expensive, but deducting pay as a punishment is a no-no, according to Samantha Reynolds, a spokesperson for A Plus Benefits, a payroll, benefits and human resources company in Boise, Idaho.She says that wage payment laws vary from state to state, but on the federal level, employees arent allowed to deduct anything from employee wages without a signed authorization from the employee to do.2. Overtime ErrorsThere are a lot of rules that can be a challenge to stay on top of, says Robert Basso, president of Advantage Payroll Services in Freeport, New York.For example, ""New York State requires that you pay an additional hour at minimum wage for any workers in the hospitality industry who work more than 10 hours in a day,"" he says.And calculating overtime when tips are involved can be a headache, he adds.So if youre struggling with payroll, Basso suggests using a timekeeping system to track hourly employees and overtime, like a user-friendly software as opposed to manual time sheets.3. Payroll ChangesForgetting to stay on top of payroll changes can also hurt business owners.""Tax laws change constantly at the federal, state and local level,"" says Samuel Kerch, director of finance at Symmetry Software, which specializes in payroll software applications for large employers and payroll providers.For instance, on May 18 of this year, the U.S. Department of Labor released revised overtime pay regulations that will take effect on December 1, 2016 and is expected to affect 4.2 million white-collar workers nationwide. The new rules increase the salary threshold for the overtime exemption from $455 a week to $913 a week. So if you have salaried employees who make $47,476 or less and they work more than 40 hours a week, you may need to pay them overtime.Assuming that yourpayroll software will account for these changes may not be a smart move. You have to make sure its being updated, Kerch warns.""Working in the software industry, I am amazed at how many people are simply apathetic to new software updates. The payroll system itself, like any software product, has bugs and problems in the underlying code. As software providers become aware of these problems, they push out updates. Those updates could address everything from incorrect logic in a given payroll situation, to security fixes, to connectivity fixes in the case of electronic payments and filing, to new features because of an overhaul in state or federal withholding rules,"" Kerch says.Moving Beyond PayrollErrorsThis doesnt meanthat you have to outsource your payroll to a third party or even use software, but it may be worth considering. Looking back on it, Clayton wishes he had consulted a labor law attorney to make sure his company was handling everything correctly.""A few thousand dollars in consulting fees would have saved me a half million dollars and two years of agony,"" he says.Not that the half million dollar expense was a complete disaster. Clayton says that his middle managers were really happy to get windfall checks of $10,000 to $15,000, although some of them, feeling bad for the company, tried to return the money.""Legally, we had to pay all of them every single dime and show proof of it, but the cool thing was that many of our team [members] were able to use the funds to put a down payment on a home or buy new car,"" Clayton says. ""We actually celebrated those stories and victories and turned the whole ordeal into a positive experience strengthening our culture.""And it worked out. When Clayton later sold his company, the buyer recognized that a business that could withstand a half-million dollar loss was a healthy enterprise. Still, if you cant afford to give back thousands of dollars to your employees, you may not want to make too many mistakes on payroll.Read articles on cash flow.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Im President at The Kaplan Group, Inc and Im based in San Luis Obispo, CA.Halloween is coming up and for business owners, unpaid invoices can be terrifying. As the owner of a commercial collection agency specializing in large claims, weve seen a lot of hair-raising business situations.Warning: these three horror stories about collections gone wrong may keep you up at night, but dont worry, we also have some advice to help make sure your story has a happy ending.A Devious BargainA customer owed our client $35,000. In an attempt to obtain the money, the client agreed that the customer could pay them when the customer started a new project. Nine months later, the new project still hadnt started.Unfortunately, because the client signed a poorly drafted agreement to wait with no deadline, we could not take the debt collection case to a judge when the debtor continued to refuse to pay. Six months later, the customer still had not started the new project and so, technically, was still not late in paying our client despite the fact that the debt was now two years old.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Dean Kaplan"" alignment=""center""]Getting help from a reputable debt collection agency as soon as possible can help keep you from being a victim.[/pullquote]This scary situation happens all the time. Once you agree to poor settlement terms, it can be very hard to take that agreement back. You dont want to spend years waiting for money, only to find out youve made a disadvantageous bargain!The Mysterious Case of the Missing CompanyA client was owed $30,000 for a consulting project. The bill was six months overdue. When we first got the debt collection claim, everything seemed to be in order. The client had a solid contract with their customer and proof that they had performed the work. They had written acceptance of the work from their customer and a written promise to pay.But we quickly knew our client would never get their money. When we investigated the company name, we couldnt find it as a registered entity. When we researched the company owner, we found that he had nearly a dozen different entities and doing business as (DBAs) registered in his name. Each used a PO Box as an address. Even more frightening, he had 20 outstanding judgments for $2 million dollars, including a recent one for over $800,000.What made this case so frustrating was that it was preventable. If this client had done just a little bit of credit evaluation, they would have known their new customer was going to ghost them. They could have insisted on payment in full up front, or they could have walked away from the opportunity and not lost $30,000 worth of time.The Sloppy ExecutionerOne of our clients had a two-year contract for $5,000/month. For the first three months, the customer paid on time. Then, for the next five months, the customer did not pay, but the client continued to provide services. The client was still providing services when they sent the debt collection claim to us.Our client wanted to stop providing services due to the customers breach of contractthe customer was no longer paying. But the contract was unclear if the customer would still owe our client for the remaining 16 months of the contract if the client stopped providing services. We knew that a judge could rule either way on this question.In addition, there was also no acceleration clause in the contract, meaning that even if the client was willing to continue providing services, we could only sue immediately for the five months that were currently past due. We could not sue for the remaining 16 months of the contract until that period had passed.The sloppy execution of the contract meant that our client had to accept $20,000 as settlement in full for a $25,000 outstanding debt. They also lost the opportunity to receive the remaining $80,000 due under the contract.If you find these stories frightening, you arent alone. Preparation and research can help keep you from starring in your own horror movie:Do your research.A simple credit check on a potential client can cost as little as $8. You probably wouldnt hand cash to a stranger with no questions asked, so why give an unknown business your time or product without a simple investigation?Know the red flags.In a horror movie the mayhem sometimes seems to come out of nowhere, but that doesnt usually happen in real life. Before a client stops paying you, or starts paying you late, there are usually signs that the business is in trouble. Learn the warning signs so you can address problems before they get out of hand.Dont agree to bad terms. When someone owes you money, its tempting to do whatever you can to recoup even some of the cash. But, as in the first story I shared, its usually a bad idea to make an agreement without some professional help. Once you offer a deal, its hard to reverse that offer.If you do find yourself walking down the long dark hallway of uncollected debt, dont go alone! Getting help from a reputable debt collection agency as soon as possible can help keep you from being a victim.Read more articles on managing money.Photo: iStock",3 Spooky Debt Collection Stories to Scare You Straight

You might be left second-guessing yourself, wondering where things went wrong and if you could have done anything differently. Of course, when losing a client, you may also be too panicked to even consider taking your clients departure personally. You may be worried about the massive loss of income toyour bank account.That said, if you stay in business long enough, you may one day experience your biggest client leaving you. It happens all the time, even to wildly successful companies. Just in the last year alone, Chik-fil-A dropped its advertising firm, after 22 years of doing business together, to go with another marketing company. Express Scripts Holding Co.saw its stock plummet after its biggest client, health insurer Anthem, threatened to leave them. And cloud-based HR software providerZenefits lost its biggest client Jet, an e-commerce company.So rather than second-guess yourself in the future, you might want to be on the alert now for any signs that you might be on the brink of losing a client.Big clients often leave clues that theyre thinking of heading toward the exits. And if your radar is attuned to those hints, you might be able to do something about itor at least scramble to find some new big clients to replace that possible loss of revenue. What are some of the red flags that your biggest client is about to depart? There are several to be on the lookout for.1.

""Think of the auto industry in 2008, the oil industry in the past few years That large-scale drama can have a huge ripple effect on other industries related to the troubled industry, and even on smaller players,"" she says.Calvin suggests that if you do have an important client in an industry in flux, this may not be the time to take your relationship for granted.""Send a little extra TLC their wayand make it as easy as possible for them to make your case to their higher-ups even when the you-know-what is hitting the fan,"" Calvin suggests.3. Your clients leadership is changing.Maybe your clients CEO or CFO has stepped down, or perhaps somebody else is out the door.Either way, ""a change to the top brass can have a troubling trickle-down effect,"" Calvin says. ""So pay attention to high-level changes and read those annual shareholder reports; theyre going to have big implications for whats coming.""4. Your client is criticizing you.This may be a fairly obvious sign, but if the gripes have been coming in slowly, you may not notice anything is truly amiss right away.""If youve been doing a great job for your client for months or even years, and they immediately start demanding more detailed reports [and giving] directions on how to do certain things, theyre likely getting ready to make a move,"" says Maren Hogan, CEO of Red Branch Media, a marketing firm in Omaha, Nebraska.If this is the case,Hogan suggests taking a lot of screenshots and compiling hard analytics to show what you have done. Howevershe concedes that in many cases,theres likely nothing you can do by this point. A competitor may have reeled in your client, and it may be that whomever youre working for is looking for a graceful way out. For your soon-to-be ex-client that way out could besuggesting you havent been living up to expectations.5. You have solved your clients biggest problem.Huh? Doing your job can mean gettingthe ol heave-ho?Yep. After all, you fixed the problem. Your client may conclude that he or she doesnt need you any longer.""Seems unfair that the result of you solving a clients biggest problem could make them feel youre not needed anymore but it happens all the time,"" Calvin says.She suggests pointing outpreferably early on, before you solve the big problemall of the other ways you can help your client.

Im going to share some strategies that may help do that.But first, theres one important step thats often vital to explosive growth:Laying the groundwork.Weve all heard about companies that got media publicity, or faced a sudden flood of demand for some random reason, only to crash and burn because they didnt have their ducks in a row. Before you undertake any rapid growth plan, its often important to lay a firm foundation for success. That may include:[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Adding related or complementary products or services to what you currently offer may be a great way to build on previous success with your existing customers.[/pullquote]Perfecting your systems and processes. Examine your business internally and make sure your operations are as simple and efficient as possible. By making the most of your existing resources, you may be able to boost profitabilitywhich mayhelp finance your growth plans.Investigating financing options. Chances are, explosive business growth will require additional capital. Prepare for this eventuality by exploring your options and lining up any funding you may need, such as a business line of credit or a working capital loan, ahead of time.Preparing your team. In order for your business to grow explosively, your employees shouldideally be ready to handle the increased demands on their abilities. They also should hopefullybe on the same page with you in regards to your ultimate business goals and objectives. It may help to get everyone excited, rather than intimidated, about the companys future.Listening to your customers. Listening to what your customers want and need may not only direct your business growth plans, but also provide valuable feedback as you grow so you know whether youre heading in the right direction. This may be important when everything in your business is changing rapidly. If you havent already done so, consider implementing customer relationship management tools, social listening and customer surveys to help stay on top of how your target market feels about what youre offering.Ready to start? Here are 7 strategies that may lead to explosive business growth, starting from the least risky and least costly option and moving up from there.1. Market PenetrationSimply put, market penetration means selling more of what you already sell to your existing market. For example, you might create a goal to get your current customers to use more of your products by upselling, adding more sales representatives to reach out to new accounts in your existing market, or devoting more budget and effort to marketing and advertising to that market.2. Market ExpansionYou might expand your market either geographically or demographically. For example, if you currently sell only to customers in your state, you could aim to expand your market by selling regionally. If your current target market is women, you might expand your market by targeting your product to men, or teenage girls, too.3. New Product DevelopmentAnother way to grow your business may be to develop new products or services to sell to your existing market. Adding related or complementary products or services to what you currently offer may be a great way to build on previous success with your existing customers.4. Product Development for a New MarketIn this growth strategy, you develop new products or services and sell them to a new market. This may be riskier than simply selling new products to existing customers, and may require more of an upfront investment. However, it might also pay off in faster growth.5. Strategic PartnershipIn a strategic partnership (also called a strategic alliance), you form an agreement with one or more other companies to work together toward an agreed-upon growth goal, while still remaining separate businesses. This may enable you to take advantage of the complementary strengths of the partner/s while still remaining in control of your own business. (A strategic partnership is a contractual relationship, but it doesnt create a new legal entity, despite the term partnership.)6. Joint VentureOne step beyond a strategic partnership, in a joint venture, you actually create a separate business entity together with another business and share in ownership of this new organization. A joint venture may be a good way to enter new markets, develop new products or services and share the risks and costs with someone else.7. Company AcquisitionAcquiring another company can power up your growth exponentially. In ahorizontal acquisition, you acquire a competing company and take it over, immediately expanding your market reach. You can either rebrand the acquired company and take it under the umbrella of your existing business, or operate it under the old brand, depending on the brand value. In averticalacquisition, you buy a company involved in a different stage of production in your industry. For example, you might purchase one of your suppliers in order to cut your material costs (this is called backwardacquisition). Or you might purchase one of your distributors so you can push more of your products into the market (this is called aforwardacquisition).Which one of these seven exponential growth strategies sounds most appealing for your business?The information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

He has been interviewed over 500 times in national and international media, including NBC, Univision and CNN.How good are you at getting other peoples money? To have a successful business youmayhave toconvince customers, vendors, investors and lenders to give you their money. The latter group can serve as a lifeline for millions of businesses. According to data from the end of 2016s second quarter,courtesy of theFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, U.S. business debt outstanding stands at a record high of more than$8 trillion.Just because there are trillions of dollars being lent to businesses doesnt mean its easy to get a loan or line of credit. Your business may have to pay higher interest rates or agree to very strict conditions on how to run your business while the loan is outstanding. Thats why small-business owners may want to prepare themselves before applying.These four steps represent the broad strokes of what maybe done to help establish your business credit. It takes time, so it may help to be prepared to start as soon as possible.Step 1: Get Your Own House in Order FirstIf your business doesnt have a credit profile yet, then most business lending decisions will likely be tied to your personal credit. Even after you establish your business credit, your personal credit may still be an important decision-making point for lenders, so it may help to make sureyour personal credit record is accurate and in the best shape possible. Consider reviewing your personal credit records from Experian, Equifax and Transunion and following their procedures for correcting errors and attaching your response to negative items that cant be removed. You should try to pay down existing debt on a timely basis and notconsume 100 percent of your borrowing capacity. You may also want to include a healthy mix of revolving lines of credit (like credit cards) and term loans (like car loans).[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]You should try to pay down existing debt on a timely basis and not consume 100 percent of your borrowing capacity.[/pullquote]Step 2: Perform a Corporate CleanupIf you want your business to have a credit record separate from your personal one, you must legally separate the two. The business needs to be established as a Corporation, Limited Liability Company or other legal entity. A sole proprietorship or partnership by definition is not distinct from its owner and therefore cant have a separate credit record.Your business should also have an Employer Identification Number and a DUNS number issued by Dun & Bradstreet. Companies that serve or plan to serve as government contractors can obtain a DUNS for free. This also means having banking accounts under the company name, and funds should never be commingled. Both in theory and practice, your business should remain a distinct entity from you to meet these requirements. Finally, you should set up business profiles with Dun & Bradstreet and Experian.Step 3: Ask Your Suppliers to HelpYour suppliers may play a critical role in helping your business establish and improve your credit. First, you can ask them to provide credit terms on your future business. As your business pays its invoices on a timely basis, you can then ask the vendors to report those timely payments to Dun & Bradstreet to help ensure your company is given credit for it. Over timeand after paying on time consistentlyyou may want to ask your vendors to increase the credit limits they have provided. Showing growth over time may be important from a credit point of view and may also help improve your businesss working capital.Step 4: Apply for Credit When You Dont Need ItThis may seem counterintuitive, but one of the worst times to apply for business credit may be when your business really needs it. Lenders may succeed or fail on their ability to assess risk, and avoid too much of it. They will likely evaluate your company based on its ability to pay back the loan or line of credit without delay. A business having a cash flow shortage, or that needs to pay a large unexpected expense, probably doesnt represent a good risk.The fact that they need the financing sends a signal that the owners may not have properly managed for the unexpected. Instead, consider applying when your company is having a great year and you can do just fine without the financing.The information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Business columnist, award-winning author, TEDx talker, nerd in a dress.The Small Business Association reports that in 2015, the U.S. was home to over 28 million small businesses that employed over 56 million people. AndWasp Barcodes 2016 State of Small Business Reportfoundthatin a survey of over 1,100 small businesses, 71 percent of small businesses are expecting growth in 2016.If youre a small business, now may look like a great time to start growing. Sohow do you keep growth up when sales are up overall,yet you dont have enoughcash to finance the day-to-days of running a business when sales hit a dip? Short-term loans may be an option.Short-Term Loans May Help Bridge GapsFinding the cash you need through short-term loans can be a smart resource to have in your toolbox.Short-term business loans are meant to bridge gaps, not offer financing for larger business ventures like purchasing equipment. (Your first hint of that is in the name: short-term.) Ifyou find yourself keeping your operating reserves at a certain level, paying for building improvements or adding much-needed developers to your payroll, short-term loans can help you out of a bind.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Erika Napoletano"" alignment=""center""]When it comes to short-term loans and lending, knowledge can be power. You may want tospend the time exploring your options before you have a need for a short-term loan. [/pullquote]Myfirst tip is to establish a relationship with your business banker. As your bank knows your deposit history, it may be easier for them to review your deposits and know what youre good for when it comes to a short-term business loan. These loans will typically have terms of less than a year and your business mayget a lump sum of cash and pay it off over an agreed upon time frame. If youre looking for even shorter time frames than a year, consider speaking with your business banker about getting a business line of credit. These operate more like a credit card in that you have an available line and can draw against whats available.TheCosts ofShort-Term LoanOnce youve established that relationship with your banker, you may want toinquire about the costs involved with using a short-term loan. This can be especially important if youre looking at online lenders.Getting a full accounting of the loan costsincluding interest rates, fees, prepayment penalties (if any) and extension feescan be beneficial. Reputable lenders should be able to provide these costs up front and prior to signing for the loan. If you dont see them, asking or even picking up the phone to speak with a customer service representative may help get you the answers you need.Finding a LenderSpeaking of where to go, Ive mentioned both your bank and online lenders as potential sources for short-term business loans. If you want to shop around online, consider doing a web search for ""short-term business loans"" and start clicking. Youre going to find a wide variety of lenders out thereand the numbers keep growing each year. Theyll each have their own lending criteria as well. For example, some lenders might not offer loans if youve been in business less than a year. Others might be more lenient with their lending criteria, but you may have to pay for that leniency via their interest rate. At the time of the writing of this piece, two popular online lenders ranged between 9 percent and 98 percent interest. While those rates may notbe comparable to what you may find at your bank, many small businesses find themselves in cash crunches where their bank might not be able to help them as quickly as they need. Thus online lenders combine speed of funding with the convenience of applying online to command higher rates.As an alternative to short-term loans, you might also want to explore invoice-based lending. This service is available from a variety of online lenders. Simply put, they use your outstanding receivables as collateral and advance you either a percentage or the full amount of an invoice. You can repay the advance over time. Typically there will be an origination fee of sorts along with fees paid for each repayment installment. You may find that you save money in fees by repaying an invoice advanced early as well.When it comes to short-term loans and lending, knowledge can be power. You may want tospend the time exploring your options before you have a need for a short-term loan. Researching short-term loans can be a fantastic task for an assistant or your bookkeeper or accountant. They cangive you a side-by-side comparison of what your bank offers along with options for online lenders for both short-term loans and receivables lenders. This way, you can have everything on-hand should the need for a short-term loanarise. Youcan thenbe able to make a more informed decision about the best short-term business loan scenario for your specific needs without necessarily being pressured by time.Read more articles on loans.For more tips on planning for business growth, access our exclusive guide from LegalZoom CEO John Suh, Move Your Business Forward.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Business columnist, award-winning author, TEDx talker, nerd in a dress.When youre busy with the business of launching a business, its easy to think you can do it all. After all, its your vision, your dreamand theres not a single successful entrepreneur out there who will tell you that saving money isnt a necessity for emerging, growing businesses. So naturally, that means you should try to handle your business finances yourself instead of working with tax professionals, right? Every penny helps.The answer is different for every business owner, but there may come a time when you cant do it all on your ownwhether youre looking to save time or money. I spokewith Bryan Clayton of GreenPal out of Nashville, Tennessee, and Kathryn Kaufman at FGMK, an assurance, tax, and advisory firm out of Chicago.Clayton hasbeen in the landscaping business since 1998; hes owned GreenPalessentially, Uber for lawn caresince 2014. As a seasoned professional in founding and running growing businesses, hes shared his tips as someone who previously thought he didnt need financial professionals to reign in his business finances. Kaufman weighs in from the tax professional side with additional insights for business owners to consider.Should Business Owners Be Their OwnTax Professionals?How many years did you prepare your own financials?Clayton: In my first company, I prepared my own financials with my own accounting software for the first five years. Now in my current company I work in partnership with a CPA to handle monthly P&Ls (profit and loss statements).Why did you decide to prepare your own financials instead of working with tax professionals?Clayton: When I was first getting started, I was self-funding the growth of my company and it was strictly a cost-savings issue. Starting your own business from scratch, you look to save money at every possible opportunity. Keeping our bookkeeping, tax preparation and financials in-house made sense when our revenue was below $2 million per year.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Brian Clayton"" alignment=""center""]The cost of handling your own financials could very well be higher when you choose to handle these things yourself, when you take into consideration penalties, your knowledge gap and the time it takes away from actually making the money youre desperately trying to track.Brian Clayon, owner, GreenPal[/pullquote]What made you seek help from tax professionals?Clayton: Eventually, I began receiving nasty late notices from multiple tax authorities that I was letting slip through the cracks. I had to reconcile that I was paying more in late fees and penalties than what I was saving by doing all of the financials and bookkeeping myself.It quickly became evident that partnering with a tax professional could actually save me money and the headaches. Whether it was a county business property tax, a state sales tax, federal income tax, state franchise and excise tax, or city income tax, as my business grew, these taxing authorities became a swarm of bees that were constantly stinging me because I had no game plan in place to stay out in front of the filing dates each of them had.What advice would you give other emerging business owners who want to maintain control of their own financials until theyre a larger company?Clayton: Realize that you can only wear so many hats, and that its best to be the best in your market at your core competency. If your core competency isnt business financials, dont feel like it has to be. The cost of handling your own financials could very well be higher when you choose to handle these things yourself, when you take into consideration penalties, your knowledge gap and the time it takes away from actually making the money youre desperately trying to track.What have been the three biggest benefits of hiring professionals to help you with your company financials?Clayton:Peace of mind of knowing that I was not committing some catastrophic financial error.Actually saving me money through better capturing of depreciation and other deductions I was unaware that I could be taking.Setting my business up with an exit plan to place the business in proper financial health to be acquired by a national organization.What advice would you give other business owners about the process of hiringand maintaining relationships withthe financial professionals you hire?Clayton: Make sure the folks you hire to handle your finances are not too small and not too big.Ive been in both situations. Starting off, I worked [with] a one-man band who attempted to help me with my financials and as my company scaled into the multi-millions of revenue. We simply outgrew his bandwidth and it was a painful process of undoing that relationship.Conversely, I have taken my business to a larger firm with hundreds of people and I was just lost in the shuffle. Nobody really cared about the health of our business and our long-term financial plans.After weeks of interviewing other financial firms, I found the sweet spot was a 10- to 15-person organization with an owner-operator CPA principal at the helm that I could meet with at anytime.The Benefits of Working With Tax ProfessionalsNow, given everything Claytons shared about his experience, lets see what Kaufman has to say about business owners who are trying to decide between a DIY approach and working with tax professionals:What are some of the biggest mistakes you see smart, seasoned businesspeople making when they try to do their own taxes?Kaufman: The most common mistakes I see when business owners prepare their federal tax returns without consulting a tax professional are missing a fair number of deductions and tax credits. Also, they concentrate so much on the federal tax return that they miss out on state tax credits.What are some good indicators that businesses have outgrown self-tax preparation and should consult tax professionals?Kaufman: Every business should consult a tax professional. As soon as someone starts a business or is looking to start a business, they should consult a tax professional, especially if they are doing business in multiple states. Businesses trying to do it on their own can miss out on many tax deductions and credits, as well as not properly classifying income and expenses. Also, I have seen businesses incorrectly file or completely miss filing in states that require filing. The result are penalties that are costly and completely avoidable.How can tax professionals help growing, mid-sized businesses year-round and not just at tax time?Kaufman: You learn more about a client year-round than just meeting once a year. Businesses should take advantage of their tax professional for everything from consulting about cash-flow strategies and savings to assistance with financing and debt covenants.Tax professionals can also help businesses review and negotiate agreements, analyze business trends and [offer] year-round tax planning. An ongoing relationship with a tax and advisory professional can help prevent year-end surprises. Those are the kinds of surprises no business owner ever wants.Making the Next MoveSo, smart and growing business owner: Where are you at on the ""need a financial professional"" spectrum? While year one might not be the right time to hand everything over to a financial pro, Claytons experience can help guide your thought process and Kaufmans insights can help you ask better questions when you do opt to engage with a tax professional.Are there things Im missing? Am I getting all of the deductions available? Am I properly depreciating my assets? While there are a ton more questions business owners may have, its handy to have someone to ask. Know when to ask for help, keep those nasty notices at bay and dont be afraid to build a solid, long-lasting relationship with a financial professional who is just as invested in the success of your business as you are.Read more articles ontax preparation.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Being as tax-savvy as possible can help youâ€”and your businessâ€”save money in the long run.,2016-09-29T17:00:01+00:00,Managing Money,Taxes,"[Cash Flow, Managing Money, Tax Deductions, Tax Preparation, Taxes]",Managing Money,John Suh,"4 Things Every Business Owner Should Know About TaxesJohn SuhCEO, LegalZoomJohn Suh has served as LegalZooms CEO since 2007 and as a member of its board since 2005. Prior to LegalZoom, John was CEO of StudioDirect, the internet division of global supply chain company Li and Fung. John also co-founded and served as CEO of Castling Group, helping to launch category leaders such as jcrew.com and hifi.com. He received a B.A. in Organizational Behavior and Public Policy from Harvard College and received his M.B.A. with high distinction from Harvard Business School.As the leader of a budding business, youre likely spending most of your waking hours focusing on three main prioritiesbuilding your team, finding customers and perfecting your product. With barely enough time to address these key endeavors, its easy to let less pressing matters, such as tax optimization, fall by the wayside.In the short term, this might seem like a harmless oversight. However, come tax season, youll wish you had done your research and understood just how many business decisions bring with them tax implications that affect your bottom line.Understanding the QuirksWhen it comes to taxesboth local and federalthere are countless quirks to take into account. For example, the City of Los Angeles has a revenue tax that can grab up to 1 percent of your gross receipts even if you werent profitable that year, while plenty of other cities would be more than happy to let you keep that money.In another example, on the federal level, if youre a qualified C corp, you can create tax-exempt appreciation for your shareholders through the use of qualified small-business stock, which may be a benefit if youre looking for new capital. Similarly, financing with SBA loans instead of private sources can give you access to a number of bottom-line boosters, including potential incentives at the local, state and federal levels.Paying attention to these factors has literally saved my company millions of dollars over the years. For example, back when we were looking to expand our operation to a new state, our real estate team informed us that we could obtain a seven-figure incentive package from the City of Austin, Texas, if we chose to open an office there. We were already attracted to this city for different reasons, but learning about this tax break definitely sealed the deal.Opportunities for the TakingHere are four areas every tax-savvy business leader should become intimately familiar with:1. The Wide World of Deductions. A substantial amount of your business expenses may qualify as tax-deductibleand you may not even realize it. According to the IRS, to qualify as a business deduction, an expense must be ordinary and necessary. Depending on what is deemed ordinary and necessary in your field, your cell phone, your car, and even the meals you buy for sales leads could qualify.2. C Corps vs. S Corps. Even if youre structured as an LLC, you can elect to be taxed as an S Corp. This allows you to avoid paying federal corporate income taxes, and your income, credits, losses and deductions are instead passed to your shareholders. This move could potentially save you thousands of dollars every year.3. Employees vs. Contractors. Do you pay your workers as employees or as contractors? It may be cheaper and less of a hassle to pay your workers as contractors, as long as you can structure their roles to meet the IRSs definition. Study up, and act accordingly.4. Retirement Savings. Any wage earner can contribute to a qualified retirement plan and should receive a deduction up to the annual limit. Business owners who set up their own retirement plans, however, can contribute and deduct substantially more$53,000 to a solo 401(k) plan in 2016 and up to $59,000 if they are at least 50 years old. For most business owners, a deduction that large would result in tens of thousands of dollars in tax savings.It may be an old saying, but it makes perfect sense as a business tax mantra: Its not what you make, its what you take home. Why pay more in taxes than you have to?The better you understand how taxes can affect your business, the more proactive you can be about boosting your companys bottom lineand the better youll feel come tax season.For more tips on planning for business growth, access our exclusive guide from LegalZoom CEO John Suh, Move Your Business Forward.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

"Just because the General Business Tax Credit isn't well known, doesn't mean it can't be beneficial to business owners, according to this entrepreneur.",2016-09-22T19:30:19+00:00,Managing Money,Taxes,"[Managing Money, Tax Deductions, Tax Preparation, Taxes]",Managing Money,Mike Periu,"The Underused Tax Credit More Business Owners May Want to Start ClaimingMike PeriuPresident, Proximo, LLCMike is a seasoned executive with experience in finance and management. He is the founder of Proximo, LLC. a leading provider of small business education and training services in both English and Spanish.Mike Periu is also a leading national voice for individual empowerment through financial education and entrepreneurship. He has been interviewed over 500 times in national and international media, including NBC, Univision and CNN.Federal tax credits are offered to businesses as a way to promote certain activities such as investing in new technologies or using more environmentally friendly sources of energy. The government believes that these activities are beneficial to society as a whole and tries to motivate private businesses to undertake them by lowering the cost to as low as zero.A tax credit can reduce your income tax liability dollar for dollar. It can be more valuable than a tax deduction, which only serves to lower your taxable income.For example, a company with $500,000 in taxable income would have a federal income tax liability of$170,000, or 34 percent of its income. If the company qualifies for a $50,000 tax deduction, then the taxable income would be reduced to $450,000 and the tax liability would drop to $153,000. So the $50,000 deduction reduced the tax bill by $17,000.If instead the company had a $50,000 tax credit, it would pay only $120,000 in federal income taxes. The credit represents an additional $33,000 in after-tax income to the business. If your company generates a 10 percent pre-tax profit margin, then that extra boost from the tax credit versus the deduction can offer the same profitability as generating an extra $330,000 in revenues.The General Business Tax CreditOver $90 billion per year in general business tax credits are claimed by businesses. In my experience though, the General Business Tax Credit (GBTC) is one of the least understood credits available to business owners.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Mike Periu"" alignment=""center""]While I dont recommend that taxes should be the primary consideration behind an investment decision, understanding the tax effects of that decision can be helpful in calculating the proper return on investment.[/pullquote]Despite the singular form of the name, it actually consists of over two dozen individual credits that are grouped together under the GBTC name. It could very well be that your company is already spending money on some of the activities that qualify for a credit. The following credits are part of the GBTC:Work Opportunity CreditAlcohol and Cellulosic Biofuel Fuels CreditCredit for Increasing Research ActivitiesLow-Income Housing CreditRecapture of Low-Income Housing CreditOrphan Drug CreditDisabled Access CreditQualified Plug-in Electric and Electric Vehicle CreditRenewable Electricity, Refined Coal, and Indian Coal Production CreditEmpowerment Zone and Renewal Community Employment CreditCredit for Employer Social Security and Medicare Taxes Paid on Certain Employee TipsCredit for Contributions to Selected Community Development CorporationsBiodiesel and Renewable Diesel Fuels CreditNew Markets CreditCredit for Small Employer Pension Plan Startup CostsCredit for Employer-Provided Childcare Facilities and ServicesDistilled Spirits CreditEnergy Efficient Home CreditAlternative Motor Vehicle CreditAlternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property CreditThe following are also included in the general business tax credit, but are directed towards a very small number of companies:Mine Rescue Team Training CreditNonconventional Source Fuel CreditQualified Railroad Track Maintenance CreditLow Sulfur Diesel Fuel Production CreditIndian Employment CreditAmerican Samoa Economic Development CreditThe rehabilitation, energy, and reforestation credits, together known as the Investment CreditMore information can be found here on the specifics of each tax credit. To apply for the GBTC, you need to fill out IRS Form 3800 plus an additional form for each credit you plan to take.Tax Credit PlanningAn important benefit of the General Business Tax Credit is that it isnt bound by the limits of spacetime. Remember that the GBTC can reduce your tax liability. But if your business doesnt make money, then you dont owe income taxes and cant use the credit even if you qualify for it. The IRS allows you to apply the credit to future years when you do have profitability. The IRS also allows carrybacks. So if you cant use the credit this year because your business didnt earn enough money, you can apply the credit to a previous years income to reduce that past tax liability and reap the benefits today.You may want tostart taking a closer look at these tax credits. You still have time to make certain investments this tax year to qualify for the credits. While I dont recommend that taxes should be the primary consideration behind an investment decision, understanding the tax effects of that decision can be helpful in calculating the proper return on investment. Projects that offer a marginal return could have a very different cost-benefit profile thanks to a tax credit.Read more articles on taxes.For more tips on planning for business growth, access our exclusive guide from LegalZoom CEO John Suh, Move Your Business Forward.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

Lets face it: Customers who are frustrated and disappointed are no fun. And no matter how careful and how thorough you are, from time to time we all make mistakes. We fail to provide our highest level of customer service and our clients dont get what weve promised.Ive really worked on my attitude toward disappointed customers, though. And while I cant claim that I actually look forward to their phone calls or emails, I have managed to implement a strategy for managing complaints in a much more positive, productive way. Heres how I do it:1. Take ownership.When a client calls me to complain, that means one of two things: that Ive managed their business personally or that theyre seriously upset.Either way, my strategy is the same. I dont pass the buck. I commit to handling the problem myself. If you hand off an already irate client, you run the risk of inflaming the situation.2. Apologize to your customer.Sometimes customers areupset for reasons that are completely out of your control. Sometimes the problem may even be the customers fault. But unless the customer is behaving irrationally, my first step is to apologize. Whether the problem was your companys fault or not, the customer wants to hear two thingsthe first is an apology.3. Commit to making it right.The next thing an upset customer may want to hear is that youll fix the problem.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Mike Michalowicz"" alignment=""center""]While you may never actually enjoy hearing complaints about how your company has dropped the ball, if youre determined to resolve problems, you may end up in better shape than you were.[/pullquote]Even if Im not sure what the remedy will be, I verbally make it clear to the customer that I take their problem seriously, and that I will work hard to resolve it.4. Ask your customer what they want to provide better customer service.Sometimes, the solution to your problem is simple. The customers upset, they tell you exactly what they want you to do and you do what they ask.Now I know resolution is frequently not that simple, but try asking the client what would make them happy. You may find their resolution is simpler than you think.5. Develop and explain your plan to your customer.For more complex problems (like ones that require research or cant be resolved on the spot), consider telling the customer exactly what you need to do and then do it.Consider being as specific as you can about how and when youll get back in touch with them, and explain what youre planning to do. Whether you need to confer with your staff or you need to determine whats possible, letting your customers know what they can expect while youre working to resolve their problem keeps them from feeling ignored.6. Follow through.If you promise to call your customer back within 24 hours, then do iteven if you havent completely resolved the problem. Avoidmaking promises you cant keep. Failing to follow through can bring you right back to square one.Now these last two steps have become the most important for me as Ive learned to transform customer experiences from bad to good.7. Fix the root problem with your customer service.Whether its a delivery service thats consistently late or its an employee that needs to be retrained, I determine what caused my customers problem and find a way to fix it.This step matters so much because its a step toward refining and improving your quality overall, which can help reduce customer complaints in the future. Actively drilling down, finding and resolving problems in your company can help make you better overall.8. Follow up to improve your customer service.This past step is what I think has really enabled me to set myself apart from everyone else in my industries. While most business owners feel relief after theyve dealt with a disgruntled customer and the owners hope they never see that client again, I seek them out.So lets say I retrained an employee that offered substandard service. Once Ive fixed the root cause of the problem, I reach out to my the customer who initially complained, and I let them know that not only did I resolve their problem the day we spoke, but Ive taken extra steps to ensure it will never happen again.By following these steps, Ive not just fixed a problem for a client, but Ive also made my company better. Ive also demonstrated to my customer that Im a rockstar problem solver. Ive had customers whod been on the verge of taking their business elsewhere who have ended up being my most ardent supportersthe kind of customer that brings me new business.While you may never actually enjoy hearing complaints about how your company has dropped the ball, if youre determined to resolve problems, you may end up in better shape than you were.Read more articles oncustomer relations.Photo: iStock",How to Turn a Bad Customer Service Experience Into an Excellent One

The fine dining Italian restaurant, which was originally owned by a restaurant group in New York, served seafood flown in from the Mediterranean, along with meats and cheeses and special pastas from Italy. The chef used a wood-fired oven and simple seasonings, like sage, rosemary and thyme. Portions were the size youd find in Europe. In those days, when Italian"" restaurant implied giant bowls of spaghetti and meatballs served with garlic bread, diners were surprised by the Tuscan concept.People really didnt know what to make of it when we opened,"" says Jack.

And not only were they disappointed with the size of the serving, with the price of it, they had a hard time relating to it,"" he says.Tamra and Jack Weiss prepare for Coco Pazzos dinner rush.Taking it a step further, Jacks now-wife, Tamra (she was a sales rep for a wine distributor when they met), put together a wine list of all Italian wines that complemented the food. There was a lot of flack about that at the time,"" Tamra recalls. Because people would come in and theyd be like, Oh my gosh, I cant believe you dont have any California wines,"" she says.But they remained dedicated to the concept, and food critics loved it. Not long after the opening, the Chicago Tribune published a story with the headline, Youd be Crazy to Miss Out on Imaginative Coco Pazzo."" In time, the place developed a devoted following from politicians, local celebrities, the business community and gourmands, establishing a reputation that lives on nearly 25 years later.Jack Weiss, along with a small group of investors, bought Coco Pazzo from a New York-based restaurant group in 2004.In 1995, Jack found another space available in one of Chicagos stylish Magnificent Mile, with that same New-York based group, opened a casual Tuscan restaurant called Coco Pazzo Caf. Nine years later, having success at both businesses, he decided it was time to break away from the restaurant group and go off on his own. He assembled a small group of investors and they bought the restaurants from the group. Today, he serves as president of Coco Pazzo restaurants.

While hes not currently working on a new restaurant concept, Jack says hes open to growing the Coco Pazzo brand if the right opportunity comes along.

While Jack spends long days at the restaurants, his wife works on- and off-site, meeting with wine purveyors and managing and training a team of servers to recommend wines that go with the food. She continues to maintain an all-Italian wine list (with the exception of Champagne) with more than 300 selections. Tamra says the job works well for her because she gets to act autonomously within the company.

Savvy business owners who are interested in reaching wider audiences and capitalizing on social media are creating videos for their brands. ,2016-11-11T13:30:52+00:00,Getting Customers,Marketing & Sales,"[Branding, Content Marketing, Finding New Customers, Getting Customers, Marketing & Sales]",Getting Customers,Charisse Conanan Johnson,"The Real Cost of Creating Videos to Help Build Your Company BrandCharisse Conanan JohnsonFounder, The Charisse Amanda GroupIt is no secret that online video is changing the way consumers absorb information, and moreover, how businesses reach their consumers. It may be why so many businesses are interested in creating videos for their brands.According to a 2016 Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reportentitled The Future of Online News Video,"" Facebook video consumption has increased by 75 percent in the past year, reaching 8 billion daily video views; over 1.5 million small businesses posted a video (or video ad) on Facebook in September 2015. (This information was based on a private conversation Reuters Institute had with Facebook.)But, how cana business create high-quality videos without breaking the bank? I recently developed an online web series for Charisse Says, my media platform that provides users with financial strategies and tactics to make solid investing decisions. Based on that experience, I can share with you how much it cost me toproduce and distribute a 10-video series, and why I think creating videos can help build your brand. Lets take a look at how I got started:1. When creating videos for your brand, determine the videos purpose.Determining the purpose of the video can be the first step in figuring out how much a video will cost.For the Charisse Says series, I decided to use the video as brand-building collateral to expand my audience, showcase my personality and establish my credibility as a future TV personality in the world of investing. Since my video did not serve as a teaser or marketing advertisement for a specific product, I viewed the production costs as a marketing investment with no direct revenue attached to the video specifically.I then assigned a budget for the video series based on my available funds. After speaking with a few video production experts, I settled on a base budget of $10,000.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Charisse Conanan Johnson"" alignment=""center""]Overall, I was able to raise my profile by creating videos for the Charisse Says brand. The webseries allowed me to offer investment knowledge and advice through the entertaining medium of video.[/pullquote]Ialso calculated the maximum amount of dollars, or $10 per viewer, I was willing to invest for each unique viewer. As a result, I felt good about the implied 1,000 unique viewers that had to watch the video in order for me to hit my intended $10,000 investment goal. I then assigned a timetable for reaching my 1,000 expected viewers: threemonths. I based my target on insights from other comparable business owners who launched a video series to boost their brand.Every company is different, and the timetable might vary depending on sector and how much marketing prowess one puts behind the efforts. Whether you have more available funds or a different investment per viewer target, its still important to establish initial goals.2. Know that there are several components that go into creating videos.With my budget in hand, I needed to find the right people to execute on the vision. For me, this meant finding:the producer,the production assistant,show marketer,video editor,business talent,set designer,graphic artist,camera operators,photographers, andactor(s).I saved some money to pay for video equipment (we rented them from a local colleges film school), meals for the video crew and unexpected expenses. Below is a breakdown of the final costs that I incurred for all of these activities.A further breakdown of the $2,500 in the top left quadrant of thechart:Business talent: $800Photographers: $500Set designer: $200Graphic designer: $200Actors: $100Other (food, equipment, etc.): $700We streamlined our costs in a variety of ways. We received a discount from the producer because we had a pre-existing working relationship. We worked with a recent college graduate camera operator, and we found a graduate student who could serve as the video editor.My video producer handled the main responsibilities for securing each of the various independent contractors, which removed these activities from my plate. This also effectively drove down the cost of my involvement. Having a producer also allowed me to focus on where I could add the most value: Creating the written content that would actually appear in the video, and having it it reflect my knowledge of investing and the business. Finally, I set aside money to market the video post-production and paid a digital strategist to release the video across multiple outlets.3. Find a way to reduce your production costs when creating videos.While I prepared to pay for all of the expected production costs, I wanted to see whether we could secure a marketing sponsorship to cover some, if not all, of the expenses. Companies expressed interest in sponsoring my webseries because they wanted to build their brand with the Charisse Says audience. I developed a sponsorship packet. The sponsorship packet explained the benefits of sponsorship, the intended audience and details of each video episode. I sent it out to three separate companies.Ultimately, I offered a marketplace lending company sole sponsorship rights for the Charisse Says pilot video webseries. Themarketing sponsorship fee covered the majority of my video production expenses. In return, I credited sole sponsorship and underwriting to the company at the beginning of each episode on the Charisse Says online platform.Since I planned to release the videos on YouTube, I had to tailor my sponsorship graphics to YouTubes sponsorship policies. I also asked them to market the webseries in their newsletter and social media channels.4. Measure your videos results.Overall, I was able to raise my profile by creating videos for the Charisse Says brand. The webseries allowed me to offer investment knowledge and advice through the entertaining medium of video. My team and I accomplished our goal of expanding my audience and effectively paid for the video production through a marketing sponsorship. To date, we exceeded our initial viewership goals by a wide margin. More importantly, my video webseries is a top destination for visitors to my site, therein reinforcing its ability to build my brand. Unexpectedly, the series has generated substantial revenue opportunities that have exceeded the cost of the video.I devoted more time than I anticipated to the shows production, which lasted three full months. I only compensated myself $800 in cash for my entire involvement. As such, I endured high opportunity and sweat equity costs for my time. That said, I was comfortable with the sweat equity investment since I viewed the video series as critical to establishing myself as a TV personality in my field, a key component to growing the Charisse Says business platform.Going forward, be mindful of how much you are willing to spend on creating high-quality video content, understand all of the activities involved to develop a good video product and figure out ways to reduce production costs.Read more articles onbranding.Photo: iStock",The Real Cost of Creating Videos to Help Build Your Company Brand
"To make a big difference in your marketing, you may need to rethinkâ€”or implementâ€”your digital ad strategy.",2016-11-03T21:00:27+00:00,Getting Customers,Marketing & Sales,"[Advertising, Customer Relations, Digital Tools, Facebook, Finding New Customers, Getting Customers, Instagram, Marketing & Sales, SEO, Social Media Strategy]",Getting Customers,Michael Koral,"5 Ways Digital Ads Can Help Grow Your BusinessMichael KoralCo-Founder &amp; COO, needls.Hi there, you can call me Michael. Im Co-Founder & COO at Needls.com and Im based in Toronto.If you want your business to be successful, you may need to advertise online.When people consider using a new product or service, one of the first things they do is check a companys Facebook page for reviews and to see if theyre active. Digital advertising is where its atand where your marketing strategy should be.But digital ads can be daunting to the small and midsize businesses because, if done wrong, a lot of time and money could go to waste.How can you reach potential new customers effectively? Consider the following five methods.1. Search AdsA great way to help drive traffic to your site is to use search ads. Used in conjunction with search engines like Google, these ads are displayed on the top and sides of search pages and show ads that are directly related to what users type in. For example, if you live in Chicago and searched Google for different types of flowers, you might get ads for flower shops in your area.Google is king when it comes to search ads, which is why it usually comes with the heftiest price tag. The average cost for running search-ad campaigns is high, but theyre great because they allow you to target people who are clearly interested in what you have to offer. An effective search campaign starts with the right keywords to target. There are many strategies when it comes to keyword selection, but as a rule of thumb, try focusing on the longer tail (long search strings with several words) versus one or two word keywords that are much more competitive.2. Display AdsDisplay ads appear all over websites and they come in different sizes and styles. They can include text, images, animation, videos and beyond. These ads are displayed in areas that are specific for advertising. Sites that encourage advertising will typically have an ""Advertise With Us"" section or something similar. If you reach out, account managers or sales reps from the site can get in touch with you to help you purchase ads.If you are a little more experienced, you can use third-party sites which allow you to advertise on many different websites at once and set your own bids for what you are willing to pay for the trafficsometimes called Real Time Bidding (RTB) or Programmatic Advertising. You can purchase an ad and be guaranteed 10,000 impressions, but once you hit that mark, your ad is no longer displayed. The hard part for SMBs is that you typically need to have your creatives designed already. Hiring a designer can be pricey, but potentially necessary if display ads are the way you want to go. Average cost for display ads are high, so running these campaigns may put a fairly large dent in the wallet of a business owner whos budget-cautious.3. Email MarketingReaching potential customers by emailing them is a tried-and-true way of getting your message out there. In order to have a successful email campaign, you should have a fairly large database of people that you want to reach. You can go about getting these lists several ways. You can create them yourself by asking people to sign up for updates about your product or service, join your newsletter or have them enter a contest where they need to provide their email and opt in for correspondence from you. (These are typically current customers.) You can build your database by asking your current subscribers to share your emails with friends and family. You can also create an offer that people need to use their email to sign up for, like a percentage off your services or a free e-book on a topic related to your product or service.The emails you send should specifically offer a service, special promotion or ask for some sort of engagement with the company, typically on social media. That being said, the most important piece of advice I can give is to provide value in your emails. It is also best to make sure your emails look professional and have impressive graphics. You dont have to spend a lot of money on getting these graphics donemany college students or recent grads are looking to add to their portfolios and can work with you for a very affordable price. Or check out freelance sites like fivver for some quick $5 custom designs.Once your emails go out, you can track how theyre doing by monitoring open rates, clickthrough rates, etc. For example, you can send an email to 500 people and youll be able to see that, say, only 160 people actually opened it. There are several SaaS options that will help automate your email-marketing campaigns, like Intercom.io, HubSpot and Constant Contact. Monitoring your stats will let you play around with things like subject lines to try to get to as close to a 100 percent open rate as you can. The average cost of email marketing campaigns is relatively low, so its definitely worth a shot for the budget-conscious entrepreneur.4. Social AdsAdvertising on social media is one of the most important places you need to be advertising online. People spend countless hours staying on top of whats happening on their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds. People are constantly asking others in their networks to recommend good hair salons in their city or where they should eat on their trip to Boston. Being a part of these platforms can make your customer acquisition a lot easierespecially because peoples profiles provide so much data. Once you tackle social ads and incorporate platforms that will automate your campaigns, you may see a big return on investment, as the average cost to advertise on social media is low.5. RetargetingPeople that visit your website are your most valuable potential clients. The above four methods of digital ads work exceptionally well when implementing retargeting as well. Simply put, retargeting lets you keep your brand in front of the people who visited your site before but quickly left. You know that they showed some interest, so youre trying to reel them back in, trying to pique interest again so that they convert into paying customers. For example, lets say you were on a big-box retailers website looking for a new rug and didnt end up pulling the trigger on any that you liked. Youd then notice that ads for the same rug will show up on your Facebook feed, local news site, etc. Retargeting can help you reach potential customers who fall into your targeted demographics, or people that have already shown interest.When I started my first business, I was extremely overwhelmed when I thought about digital advertising, but by doing a lot of research and then testing different options, I was able to teach myself the basicsand then continued to grow my skills. I now co-own a digital advertising startup, needls.com, where I help many business owners solve the same problems I had when starting out.Dont let digital ads scare you, folks. Once you get the hang of it, you may see a huge increase in salesand youll wonder why you didnt do it sooner.Photo: iStock",5 Ways Digital Ads Can Help Grow Your Business

Im Founder & CEO at Rand Internet Marketing, LLC and Im based in Fort Lauderdale, FL.As a busysmall-business owner, you may wonder if its worth the time and effort to maintain a blog on your website.If you want to increase the visibility and credibility of your company to consumers, youmight considerregularly posting quality content on your website that will be interesting and useful to them. A blog is where this content may be housed, whether or not you call this section of your website a blog. On many sites, the blog has a different label, such as News, Press or Articles.Here are six reasons why your small business website should consider a blog.1. Drive traffic to your website.In addition to the ROIa website with a blog may generate, websites with blogs may be able to getmore traffic than websites without blogs. How do blogs drive all this additional traffic?Good SEO results are largely driven by new content and relevant keywords, which means fresh content and a place to house it. Blogs provide you with the platform to do just that. Adding fresh content to your website may help it place higher in search engine results than other websites, which could make it more likely to get clicked.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Adding a blog to your small-business website may just make sense. With minimal expense and effort, you can boost search engine rankings, build credibility, increase website traffic and foster relationships with customers.[/pullquote]2. Convert traffic into leads.Now that your website is getting more traffic, you have the opportunity to convert that traffic into leads. Each new piece of content may give you the opportunity to generate leads, and the way to do that may be by adding a call-to-action to each blog post. Try offeringsomething that consumers will give up their contact information for, such as a free e-book, free webinar, free consultation or quote. Once you have their contact information, your sales team can follow up with those leads.3. Become an authority.The best small-business blogs can answer potential customers common questions and discuss industry trends. If potential customers view your blog as one that can provide helpful information about relevant topics, they may be more likely to do business with you than with your competitors. Interesting and unique content can also give you the opportunity to drive traffic to your website through inbound links.4. Build relationships with potential customers.The comments section on your blog may be a place on your website where you can have a two-way discussion with consumers. Encouraging engagement on your blog might be as simple as asking questions at the end of a post to get the conversation going, waiting for readers to leave comments and then interacting with those readers.

Snapchat has captured the attention of those who use the visual social network daily. But is Snapchat marketing right for your business as a potential vehicle for growth?,2016-10-19T19:30:59+00:00,Getting Customers,Digital Tools,"[Branding, Content Marketing, Customer Engagement, Digital Tools, Getting Customers, Mobile, Social Media Strategy]",Getting Customers,Glen Stansberry,"Snapchat Marketing: Could It Help Grow Your Business?Glen StansberryCo-founder, GentlemintHi there, you can call me Glen. Im Co-founder at Gentlemint and Im based in Lawrence, Kansas Area.There has been a lot of buzz around Snapchat recently. The quirky app that has everyone taking selfies with strange filters has become very popular with millennials, according to a 2015 survey of more than 2,000 18-29 year olds conducted by theHarvard University Institute of Politics. eMarketer reports that Snapchathas surpassed the user bases of Pinterest and Twitter, and that its growth rate ""far exceeds that of mobile messaging in general."" Through their own research, eMarketer estimates that Snapchats ad revenues will near $1 billion in 2017.You dont earn money like that unless youve provided some sort of value to the people using your service, and Snapchat has done just that. And that means businesses are looking into Snapchat marketing more seriously.Snapchat has created a sticky service that is hard to put down and even harder to explain to someone whos never used it. Many people may think of the visual social network as goofy, confusing and seemingly serves no purpose.But you, fair business owner, dont have to care how useful Snapchat is. You probably just want to know if it will ultimately help increase your sales! Ill answer that question in a second, but first let me unpack what Snapchat is.Snapchat BasicsIf you dont already know how Snapchat works, its very different from other social networks. Usually when you post something on social media, its available for everyone to seeunless you delete it. Snapchat operates almost entirely the exact opposite of the social network norm and deletes your content in a day.For starters, the snaps"" (photos or videostaken on Snapchat) can only be seen by followers within 24 hours of the original posting.The content cant be saved, linked to or accessed by others unless they screenshot your snap. You can only view the image for up to 10 seconds before it disappears.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Glen Stansberry"" alignment=""center""]If youre targeting (or trying to target) 18-34 year olds, you may want to look into Snapchat.[/pullquote]Snapchat is pretty simple on the surface: When it comes to actually creating content, you just whip out your phone and record a video or take a picture. Then you can add filters, text or emojis and send it off to your followers.You can add a number of images and videos together to create what Snapchatcallsstories. Snapchat stories can be viewed infinitely until 24 hours have passed, and then theyre deleted.Its also important to considerhow people use Snapchat. Snapchat is typically used when people have a moment of leisure time. People using the app want short, digestible content that is compelling. Snapchat stories aregreat for this. They allow you to tell a story about your brand without taking up too much time or attention. You can be brief, fun and to the point.IsSnapchat Marketing for You?So now that weve got the nuts and bolts of Snapchat down, let me answer the question you really want to know: Can Snapchat marketing help your business?There are certain industries that are better suited for Snapchat than others, and yours may or may not be a good fit for the quirky social network.For now, Snapchat is the hot thing for younger people. According to the company, ""on any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of all 18-34 year-olds in the United States."" If youre targeting (or trying to target) 18-34 year olds, you may want to look into Snapchat.However, youll probably need to dedicatetime and resources toward your Snapchat marketing efforts. For starters, you have to actually create content on Snapchat that resonates with your demographic, which can take some planning. Butunlike Instagram or Facebook, Snapchat users wantraw, authentic and even unprofessional content. This is good news for you! Your snaps dont have to look perfect, and in fact its not encouraged. The content just needs to look authentic.Winningat SnapchatIn the Snapchat ecosystem, the goal is to be informal and clever, if you can pull it off. Stuffy business jargon, highly edited commercials and other canned marketing materials may not perform aswell.Here are some different ways brands have used Snapchat to engage with and grow their following.Behind the scenes access: Pulling back the curtainand showing your followers what your company is like can be a great source for engaging content. You can show how your product is made, how your employees interact at work and other non-salesy things that might be interesting.Exclusive coupon codes: If people watch through an entire story that youve created, consider giving them a coupon code to reward their dedication. This can help encourage your followers to pay attention to you in the future.Give private content:Consider rewarding followers with private, follower-only content through Snapchat. Giving them incentive for following your account and interacting with your brand on the service can help your brand stand out.Give sneak peeks of new products:You can give your fans a reason to be excited about following you by teasing new products that are coming soon. This can help build anticipation (and mindshare) while youre putting the finishing touches on the product.If you decide to get started using Snapchat as a way to engage and attract customers, then theres no time like the present. But if you decide that Snapchat isnt a good fit for your company, thats okay too.There are plenty of other networks you can concentrate on that might be a better fit for your business goals instead.Read more articles on social media strategy.Photo: iStock",Snapchat Marketing: Could It Help Grow Your Business?

Ive been involved in small business and entrepreneurship for almost 25 years working on the business side at The Wall Street Journal, Inc. magazine and Entrepreneur Media in addition to running my own media companies in the SMB space.To paraphrase a famous author, the holiday season can be the best of times, or the worst of times for entrepreneurs. For millions of businesses, the upcoming holidays represent the biggest and best opportunities to grow their companies; launching new products, opening new locations and finding new customers are in many plans for the final three months of the year.Unfortunately, 20th century marketing tactics for finding new customers are also in the plans for some of these companies. What they may notrealize is that what worked in the past may not generate the same results in 2016. The customer landscape has changed dramatically. In order to connect with prospects today, business owners need to think like todays consumers. Here are three strategies that can help you find new customers for the holiday season.1. Learn to hit a moving target.If your business wants to connect with existing customers and prospects, consider adding mobile marketing toyour overall strategy. Mobile searches can trigger follow up actions, such as a call, visit or share. In addition, consumers are reading emails on their phonesso you may want tomake sure that your message is mobile friendlywhen you create emails and/or ads. Few things are more frustrating to consumers than marketing messages and websites that dont display well on their smartphones.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Brian Moran"" alignment=""center""]One factor in a businesss potentialsuccess this holiday season may be their ability to connect with customers and prospects on various platforms.[/pullquote]You may want tofind the best local search terms for your businessand use them in the content you create for your website and social media messaging. Also consider providing a simple call to action, for example, a 15 percent discount to mobile users who visit your store or buy something from your website.2. Build your social media presence.Consumers are using social media to gather more information on the products and services they plan to purchase. They are also posting pictures, reviewing retail establishments and connecting with like-minded people to discuss their interests. Is your business part of these discussions? Have you successfully built a social media account on the most relevant platform (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn) to connect with customers and prospects?Staying on social medias sidelines isno longer an option for most businesses; its not too late to start building your presence in time for the holiday season.3. Drop the megaphone.Social media can be beneficial whenit is used properly. If all you do is talk about your products or services, it can be easier for people to tune you out.Remember: Social media is a dialogue, not a monologue. Consider taking the time to learn how to build relationships, provide insights and support the efforts of your customers and prospects using social media. Answer their questions, ask questions of your own and be sincere in your approach to the conversations. This can be a winning formula to building solid relationships for the upcoming holidays.One factor in a businesss potentialsuccess this holiday season may be their ability to connect with customers and prospects on various platforms.

"In light of recent attacks, cybersecurity is more important than ever.

Im Writer/Author/Publisher/Speaker at Garden Guides Press and Im based in Orange County, California Area.Think a baby monitor leading to a widespread cyberattack sounds more like a television show than real life? Think again. The recent cyberattack that prevented access to major sites, including Twitter, Netflix and Spotify, could be coming to a computer near you.The increasing sophistication of computer hackers and their methods means they are constantly taking new and different routes to attack computer networks.DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attacks have become more frequent. Due to the massively deployed secret botnetsmalware running on computers all over the globehackers can release DDoS attacks against any targetfor a very low cost, says cybersecurity expert Gary Miliefsky, CEO of SnoopWall. ""Most new Internet of Things devices, from Smart TVs to baby monitors to your home wireless router, have weak operating systems, weak encryption and are easily infected with botnet code used en masse to perform these kinds of attacks.Cyberattacks Have BecomeMore SophisticatedHackers have learned that you dont always have to attack directly to disrupt access to one or more e-commerce sites, says Ronald Nutter, author of The Hackers are ComingHow to Safely Surf the Internet. The recent attack involving Amazon and other sites involved an attack on a specific server providing DNS [Domain Name Server] resolution. The attack didnt directly affect the servers providing the content, but it effectively accomplished the same result. Since the latest breach involved a DDoS type of attack, it presented an additional challenge, because the source of the attack was coming from multiple locations at the same time.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Eric Biderman"" alignment=""center""]In addition to the cost and effort associated with identifying the cyberattack and managing the effects of it, the potential damage to the businesss reputation among customers and potential customers [is just as disruptive].Eric Biderman, counsel,Arent Fox LLP[/pullquote]The higher the profits, the more sophisticated hackers become, notes Nick Nascimento, founder of the IT services company, Sentage Systems. He is trained as a HIPAA Privacy and Security Expert.The new world of cyber criminals is more organized and actually composed of big businesses and groups that work together as well or even better than any legitimate business, says Nascimento. Hacker tools have become much stronger and their resources have begun to match and in some cases exceed the resources we use to fight them. It is truly a race. Along with the Pros [out for financial gain], we have to deal with all the one uppers, who create and post their tool on the internet right along with full instruction and even hosting options.Cyberattacks Can Be Potentially DisastrousTherecently launched [attack] caused unknown dollar damage, says Nascimento. I have personally seen a DDoS attack cost an online electronics retailer an estimated $126,000 in sales in just half a day as it crippled their online catalog. Our company specializes in protecting medical and financial information, which is undergoing pressure every day. A breach in these areas and the resulting fines and penalties can put a company out of business.Cyberattacks can be damaging for businesses on multiple levels, adds Eric Biderman, counsel for law firmArent Fox LLP. In addition to the cost and effort associated with identifying the cyberattack and managing the effects of it, the potential damage to the businesss reputation among customers and potential customers [is just as disruptive]. [They]may no longer feel confident that their personal information is safe with the business.4 Steps to Help Protect Your Company from CyberattacksAs a business owner, you can be the first line of defense when it comes to protecting your company against cyberattacks. Consider the following steps to preventing hacks in the first place.Adopt a company-wide security policy. Very few companies plan a defense against cyberattacks. This is a mistake, believes Nascimento. Have a set of security measures to protect your data, such as in the area of verbal communication and confirmation. A majority of penetrations we see are emails that are opened by employees, who admit after the fact that they thought things looked a little strange, but they opened the suspect emails anyway, and it was too late. A protocol that requires employees to call one another to confirm if an email has been sent asking for sensitive information can prevent a hack.Secure and update. In order to succeed, mass attacks require that millions of users fail to keep their machines and networks secure and updated, says Nascimento. Stop hackers in their tracks with regular deep scans for malware, viruses and rootkits.Be proactive. Harden your network by removing vulnerabilities, patching your system and start using real-time backups and real-time encryption everywhere, says Miliefsky. If we were all to do this, breaches would fail to cause damage or steal valuable information. Also audit your devices for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and get a patch or reconfigure them to remove their holes before they become part of botnets. Look up your equipment on the U.S. governments national vulnerability database to see what holes the equipment might have and for instructions to fix any problems.Purchase cyber-insurance. To protect your company from economic harm in the event a breach does occur, consider purchasing cyber-insurance, suggests James Westerlind, counsel with Arent Fox LLP.A good cyber policy would provide first-party coverage to fix the companys system [if it was damaged], as well as cover the losses of profit caused by the companys system becoming inoperable as a result of a DDoS attack.When choosing a cyber-insurance policy, Westerlind advises that business owners consider the self-insured retention, sub-limits and policy provisions that specify how long the service denial must occur and the percentage of network unavailability that must result for coverage to apply.Read more articles on digital tools.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

This is an important question that business owners should consider asking themselvesevery so often. In addition to staying current on the technological changes, revamping your website may also help yougrow revenue. A brand new site may be called for if your business changes direction or a new product launches.Regardless of the impetus, overhauling your entire site may be daunting. After going through a few website relaunches over the last year that cost $10,000 to $15,000, I want to share three steps that can help increase your chances of having a successful revamp.Now, these three steps are predominantly for business owners who do not have a fully staffed internal design or tech team that builds and manages your current website. As a result, these steps may be more applicable for businesses where the end product or service is not the technology itself, and an external vendor provides your technology needs.Step 1: Develop a concrete vision for the new website.Your vision includes what you want to achieve with the revamp.Do you expect more traffic or sales to come from the website? What business goal do you hope to achieve that the current site does not? For instance, your new site might reach a new target audience and offer an entirely different product.If you do not have a CTO, tap into your tech network and ask about the technological must-haves for the new site. For instance, with the Charisse Saysrevamp, my CTO friends at other companies implored me to design the site to be mobile responsive.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]With a coordinated strategy, you have the opportunity to tell your businesss new story with a fresh voice.[/pullquote]Your vision must also be accompanied by the financial realities of your business. You shouldallocate enough money to successfully achieve your revamp without breaking the bank. While the nature of the revamp varies across businesses, many will spend several thousands of dollars to start. If you are hard-pressed to come up with the cash immediately, try to negotiate a deferred payment option, or provide a service/product in lieu of a cash payment.You will likely need enough cash to maintain the site once the revamp is complete. Consider using a custom WordPress or other content management system theme to save on maintenance costs, because your team can more easily manipulate the site post-launch without hefty tech support.Step 2: Secure the right talent to work on the revamp.Key job functions often include:Graphic design and logo creationUser interface (U/I)User experience (U/X) designerFront-end Web developerBack-end Web developerProject managerBusiness intelligence expertFinding a graphic designer who can develop the look and feel of your site may be necessary at the beginning of the revamp process. A good graphic designer will likely ask you to fill out a creative brief questionnaire to assess the basics of the organization, aesthetic preferences and branding approach. If you have favorite sites, it may be helpful to let your graphic designer know why you like these sites as well as what site aspects are most appealing. In the end, your graphic designer will hopefully develop a style guide, which has your fonts, colors and potentially a new logo. The style guide can help inform anyone who works on the site going forward.If youre lucky, you will find the U/I, U/X and development (front-end and back-end) roles all at one shop. Companies like MU/DAI Design have all of these functions under one roof, which can be veryefficient. Team structures such as these provide an integrated approach to building your new website, which maytranslate into quick, yet comprehensive, deliverables.A good full-service Web development shop will hopefullycome with a project manager who can take the project to the finish line.For instance, the MU/DAI team can help develop the user flow, site navigation, call-to-action use cases, storyboard analysis, prototype and finished working files for a website.A founding partner or owner generally provides the business intelligence to the Web development team. You likely know your business better than the person building it, so it helps to lean in to this role and embrace this responsibility. It will likely be hard to delegate the business intelligence for the site because youre the owner. The more input you provide, the better the results you may achieve.Step 3: Spread the word and measure success.The release of any new site hopefully aligns with the marketing goals of the organization. If customers dont use your new site, then a site revamp may be only an academic exercise that wont yield tangible business results. Hopefully, your businesss marketing experts will be involved throughout the process so your work wontbe in vain.Consider letting your customers know about your website revamp through a newsletter and on social media. With a coordinated strategy, you may havethe opportunity to tell your businesss new story with a fresh voice. Consider providing an incentive for users or customers to explore or purchase something from the site.Finally, measure the success of your efforts. If you use a custom WordPress theme, you can install Yoast SEO and Google Analyticator, two plug-ins that help you keep track of your sites activity. Ultimately, youll want to know if your business is growing as a result of your site revamp, and hopefully youll have a positive return on your investment.Follow these steps and you may be in a good position to build on your existingfoundation.Read more articles about websites.For more tips on planning for business growth, access our exclusive guide from LegalZoom CEO John Suh, Move Your Business Forward.A version of this article was originally published on September 18, 2015.

"If your business has a website, you've already taken a big step toward international sales. These five tips can help you use your website to sell to the world's buyers.",2016-09-08T20:00:52+00:00,Planning for Growth,Growth Opportunities,"[Business Expansion, Digital Tools, E-Commerce, Growth Opportunities, Planning for Growth, SEO, Websites, Business Expansion, Grow Global]",Planning for Growth,Ed Marsh,"How to Use Your Website to Help Grow Your Business GloballyEd MarshFounder, Consilium Global Business Advisors, LLCHi there, you can call me Ed. Im Founder at Consilium Global Business Advisors, LLC and Im based in Ipswich, MA.How would you feel if I said you can take your company global? Sound scary?What if I said your company may already be global?Its true. Even if you have not realized it, you are likely already running a global business and have taken a huge step toward profitable international sales.The internet makes nearly every company global.If you have a website, an e-commerce store or even a Facebook page, buyers from around the world can find you. Its really that simple. Thats why so many of the traditional rules and myths of sales growth through exporting are being turned on their head, especially for small and mid-sized companies.According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 95 percent of the worlds buyers and 70 percent of the purchasing power is outside the U.S. Theres a massive potential market, and many are interested in Made in USA products and services.If the buyers are out there, and you can figure out how to sell to them safely and effectively, then why not do so?The following five tips may help get your business pointed toward profitable growth from global sales by building on the website and digital footprint that you already have to promote your business at home in the U.S.1. Simplify global transactions.Selling internationally will be different than selling domestically, but luckily there are internet tools to help easily guide you through transactional steps. Payment in different currencies, like customs and shipping paperwork, can feel daunting. Payment platforms and integrated international shipping tools provide simple solutions perfectly suited to both rookies and veterans in global trade. Follow their step-by-step processes and youll be expertly guided through the details of your international transactions.2. Mine the data.The good news is that you may already have great information about the global demand and opportunities for your product or service. For example, companies may field requests on occasion from foreign tourists who find their product while visiting the U.S. and inquire how to purchase it back home. Even if youre not receiving explicit inquiries, odds are you have international website visitors. An easy way to learn what countries your website visitors are coming from is to install a routine Google tracking code on your website. The tracking code will provide analytics that allow you to quickly identify stats and trends for website traffic. The data can be helpful, for instance, when youre fielding inquiries from potential reps.If your site traffic shows that a certain market has sales potential, you may want to focus your efforts there first. Later you may even create special content for those target markets, but thats down the road.3. Bridge the language gap.Many of the worlds potential buyers read English, but not all do. Dont overlook the importance of making content as accessible as possible for your target market of potential customers wanting to learn about what you have to offerand place their orders.If youre worried translation services arent in your budget, Googles website translator is a handy and free tool which makes your website instantly available to visitors who prefer a different language; it appears as a button on the page that visitors can use to select a language and auto-translate the content. Is it a perfect, colloquial translation? No, but its a very functional and practical solution to help visitors from around the world do business with you in their language of choice.4. Ensure mobile accessibility.Creating a mobile-friendly website through a separate subdomain or a .mobi domain used to be another hurdle for companies to jump, but that is no longer the case. Fortunately, responsive site templates mean that todays websites automatically render properly on all types of devices in all orientations. Domestically, this is important because search engines may omit sites that arent mobile friendly from search results on a mobile device. And its beneficial to your customerspoorly formatted websites may deter consumers from staying on the page.While a mobile-friendly website is important at home, its even more so in markets with limited hardwired internet infrastructure. This and other cultural factors result in a higher percentage of mobile internet usage in many international markets as compared to the U.S. Further, the prevalence of 3G coverage and fee-per-megabyte billing mean that faster-loading, optimized sites will be more successful with buyers in emerging markets. Make sure images are appropriately sized and that all features are necessary for website functionality.5. Create a content-rich website.Remember that international buyers may be uncomfortable calling you to speak in Englishnot to mention that time zones may make that impractical. That doesnt mean that they are hesitant to learn about your products by reading English. The same sort of rich content marketing that makes your website effective domestically can support your global growth.Let potential buyers learn at their own pace by ensuring common questions are answered on your site. Fill your website with easily digestible details and make it easy to ask questions. A single Contact Us"" form can be intimidating and cumbersome. Most website publishing tools offer functionality or plugins that let you drop basic forms onto many pages on your site, or even special forms specific to the content on that page. That makes it really easy for buyers to ask questions, whether theyre domestic or international.A Proven ApproachIm routinely amazed by the inspiring success stories I encounter. Companies that start out with no global ambitions can evolve into multi-million dollar global businesses. It is not unheard of for a hobby, like a small online shop, to turn into a global enterprise. As foreign and domestic buyers find companies, business owners are able to follow the market opportunity and discover growing markets and profitable sales.Today the accessibility of the internet means that nearly every company with a website is global, and the question is not necessarily how to find global buyers, because theyll find you. Today the question you should ask yourself is, When do I start?""Photo: iStock",How to Use Your Website to Help Grow Your Business Globally

We create content for small business websites and major marketers wanting to connect to entrepreneurs. We also own the small business blog, www.SmallBizDaily.com.People todaynot only want the personal touch from customer service representativesthey expect it. Fortunately for entrepreneurs, personalized customer service is one area where small businesses can really shine.Whether youre a retailer providing customer service in person, or a B2B business with a devoted call center, here are some tactics you and your employees can use to personalizeyour customersexperiences.1. Use their names.You may want to learn the names of your loyal and frequent customers so you and your employees can greet them by name. You can also use your customers names in communications with them, whether thats direct mail or email newsletters.Consider having your customer service reps usetheir real names, too, in emails, chats, phone calls or other interactions with customers. It can be a lot more personal than communicating with ServiceRepresentative@YourBusiness.com.2. Smile and make eye contact for more personalized customer service.This may sound obvious, but its something too many front-line employees fail to do. As texting and social media replace face-to-face communications, were increasingly seeing a lack of basic social skills among young, entry-level employees.Consider training everyone ongiving customers a friendly greeting and pleasant smile, and looking them straight in the eye.3. Implement a loyalty program.Loyalty programscan be as simple as giving out paper punch cards (Buy 10 sandwiches and your next one is free!) or spontaneously offering a regular customer dessert on the house.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Rieva Lesonsky"" alignment=""center""]Something as simple as asking a customer how the weather is where they are or if they have fun plans for the weekend can help humanize the experience.[/pullquote]Butyou may want totake it up a notch by using digital loyalty programs such as Belly or LevelUp.Digital loyalty programs can helpyou do more than just offer rewards. These programs can gather data about customer behaviors and can help you market to customers in more personalized ways. For example, you can create tailored marketing campaigns based on the specific products customers are interested in or how they prefer to buy.4. Offer multiple customer service channels.Some customers like to get help via live chat, others would rather send an email, and still others want to talk to a live person on the phone.By providing multiple touch points for accessing customer service, you can allow customers to personalize their experience using the method(s) they prefer.5. Be human.Have you ever talked to a customer service rep who you could tell was just reciting rote answers off a script? It can make you feel like they arent really listening to you.Contrast that with customer service reps who chat with you while theyre working on your issue. Something as simple as asking a customer how the weather is where they are or if they have fun plans for the weekend can help humanize the experience. (Bonus: It can also help humanize your reps so customers may be more patient with them.)6. Collect and share customer data.This can be as old-school as a file card system (like the kind a hairdresser might use to jot down customers names, contact info, personal details and cut and color preferences). However, its a lot easier to go digital with customer data. Customer relationship management (CRM) software or help desk software like FreshDesk or ZenDesklets you maintain detailed records about your customers and their previous interactions with your business. If your customer service employees can all access this information, they can then personalize interactions by referencing previous orders or past service issues.7. Create smooth transitions.Sometimes, your customer service employees have to hand a customer off to a manager, another representative or a different department, either in person or by phone. Making sure these transitions go smoothly can help keepthecustomerfrom feeling like they gotleft hanging.In person, consider having employees explaining the issue to the manager before leaving. And on the phone or online, have employees explain what theyre doing (Im going to transfer you to Steve in our accounting department) and give the customer a direct phone line or email address to use if they get cut off.8. Make recommendations.Using information about customers past purchasing behaviors can help make it easier for you to recommend new products they might like. For instance, a retailer could make suggestions when customers visit the store, or send them an email or text message when new products come in that they might like.E-commerce businesses may want toadd a recommendation feature to their websites. These offer suggestions for similar or complementary purchases to shoppers as they browse products or services, or put items in their carts.Are you using technology to offer personalized customer service experiences for your customers?

"Getting shoppers riled up for a big in-store sale is one thing, but how do you build that same excitement online?

At Indigenous we combine the essential elements of Web Hosting, Content Management, Digital Marketing, CRM and E-Commerce into a next-gen SaaS platform. Mypassion is helping people build and grow their businesses on-line.While customers may love the convenience of online shops and services, e-commerce purchases can often lack the excitement and community feel of an in-store buying experience. Especially during a big sale or event, customers can feed off of the delight of other shoppers getting great deals. So how can an online businessor a brick-and-mortar location looking to better leverage its digital presencecreate the same sense of excitement and urgency through their online platforms? From your website to social media channels to email marketing, these strategies may help you better connect with your digital audience.Prepare Your Website for Sales SuccessThe goal of your website is to reach, engage and convert customers. Think of your homepage or landing page like a storefront window. Include clear messaging about sales and promotions up top and vivid imagery to help draw customers in.Getting permission to use trust icons, such as the logo of a state chamber or local business bureau, can help give your online business a sense of establishment.To help ensure customers can browse and purchase smoothly, make sure that your e-commerce platform is set up with accurate pricing, discounts and links before your flash sale or online event begins.Make sure your site looks good and functions well on mobile devices, too, since many customers may be shopping on the go. If you have a custom site, try working with your developers to test your site experience for mobile compatibility and load time, or use testing tools like BrowserStack, which allow you to view your website across various browsers and operating systems. This can help ensure customers are getting the best site experience, no matter what device theyre using.Create Hype Around Your EventAnnounce your event, whether its a flash sale or live social chat, through emails and social posts in the days and weeks leading up to it. Even more enticingly, consider offering some surprises that customers will want to tune in for. For example, you can launch limited-time special deals in a dedicated section of your website. This can help drive customers to check back frequently so they dont miss out.[pullquote alignment=""center""]Testimonials are thedigital equivalent of having a happy customer offer a compliment in-store that can be overheard by other shoppers.[/pullquote]Include testimonials and reviews on your own site, but also highlight and respond to unsolicited comments and replies on social platforms to help create buzz. Testimonials provide social proof and can be as simple as a quote from one of your customers. They arethe digital equivalent of having a happy customer offer a compliment in-store that can be overheard by other shoppers.Giveaways on social media that require customers to follow your account and include an appropriate hashtag can also help get the word out, and encourage people to take action. Pick a short, unique hashtag for your special event and use it across all social channels. Encourage your customers to use the hashtag to search for future sales or events. You can also use the hashtag to pull a custom Twitter newsfeed onto your own website, linking your social activity back to your homepage or landing page.Sure, this may not lead to direct sales, but if people enjoy the images and messages you post, theyll have more of a reason to continue following and engaging with your brand.Strike Up a ConversationInvite customers to live chats or webinars, which might not only get you on their calendars, but also provide a human element to your company. Facebook Live and Twitters Periscope have become incredible, real-time channels to connect with customers. Try showing clips of what goes on behind-the-scenes to design and create products they love. You can host guest experts or stream chats between the employees and founders, allowing your customers to see the people behind the business. This can help personalize your web presence and the customers experience of your company. Afterwards, you can use recorded videos as content for your website.There are also live web chat solutions that you can easily integrate into your website. These canallow website visitors to make inquiries in real time, or you can proactively reach out to a site visitor and have a personal dialoguejust like saying hello whensomeone walks into a store.Remember to Say, ""Thank You""Be prepared to send follow-up emails and offers to thank the new contacts you acquire during your sales event or social campaign, whether or not they clicked the Buy button that day. For customers who were browsing products, does your e-commerce platform allow you to see if they got stuck at the shopping cart? Maybe they just need a little reminder. Many platforms can auto-send cart abandonment emails, inviting customers to return and complete their purchase. You may even consider offering a discount as an incentive to do so.And just like any good business owner, be sure to thank your visitors and followers. Politeness and acknowledgement can go a long way when the time comes to promote your next event. Include links to your social media platforms in all emails, newsletters and near blog posts to encourage customers to look for your business in other channels.Ask Your Customers for FeedbackUse your event as a learning experience. Consider creating a brief survey or Twitter poll to help you learn more about customer needs. If possible, consider rewarding those that complete it with a discount code. Respond promptly and graciously to any comments or feedback.As more and more businesses integrate their brick-and-mortar and online presences, or forego physical locations altogether, it can be even more critical to provide a focused and pleasurable customer experience. Whether youre an e-commerce site looking to drive sales or a coffee shop posting about sustainable sourcing on Facebook, consider all the ways you can connect with your online community.Photo:Christopher Lane",How E-Commerce Sites and Storefronts Alike Can Help Engage Customers Online
"How can making people laugh help inspire customer loyalty? These five strategiesâ€”from making friends to giving back to your communityâ€”may help keep customers happy, and invested in your success.",2016-10-26T14:30:11+00:00,Getting Customers,Customer Relations,"[Advertising, Customer Engagement, Customer Feedback, Customer Relations, Digital Tools, E-Commerce, Getting Customers, Websites, Small Business Saturday]",Getting Customers,Mike Michalowicz,"5 Ways to Help Your Business Inspire Customer LoyaltyMike MichalowiczAuthor, Profit FirstI am the author of Profit First, The Pumpkin Plan and The Toilet Paper EntrepreneurBringing new customers into your business can be crucialbut it can also cost money and time to find them. And youve got competition out there working hard to pull your existing customers over to the dark side. So how can you help keep new and existing customers happy and coming back?The answer may beto inspire customer loyalty. Loyal customers dont change brands just because the other guys stuff is on sale. Loyal customers dont abandon you just because one of your employees made a mistake. Loyal customers are your most valuable commodity, and theyre worth building, nurturing and rewarding. Consider taking the time to develop a plan to help keep customers dedicated to your business. These five strategies may help.1. Decide the customer behavior you want to encourage.You may have a hard time designing a plan or customer loyalty program if you havent decided on a desired outcome. Whether youre targeting a higher spend per customer or youre working to increase repeat visits to your website or storefront, youre likely to see better results if you know what your goal is. If you own an ice cream shop, for example, youre probably not going to see a great response if you offer a discount on purchases over $100. But a traditional punch card or smartphone app like Belly that rewards multiple visits may bring customers in more frequently and help incrementally increase sales. Figure out what works for your business model and it may help improve your bottom line.2. Offer loyal buyerssomething exclusive.This strategy may work especially well for retailersthathandle hard-to-get items that are in high demand.Offering those cherries to your best customers mayhelp produce fans for life.[pullquote alignment=""center""]Loyalty is about making customers feel like theyre part of the family, like theyre invested in your success.[/pullquote]I spoke to the manager of a local beer shop near my house, and she explained their loyalty program. Customers buy an annual membership in exchange for a custom pint glass, discounts on craft beer and exclusive access to limited-production beers. She said theysell out of single bottles of beer that cost $20 or more nearly every week. And their customers are thrilled. Try thinking of an exclusive offering you can reward your most loyal customers with.3. Make friends with your customers.While your business may deliver an excellent product (the best-tasting ice cream cone or the most thorough housecleaning) if you treat your customers like theyre just a number, youre unlikely to inspire loyalty.Give your customers a chance to get to know you and your staff, and you may be surprised at how loyal they become. Use your small-business status as a badge of honor by taking the time to learn your customers names, and their likes and dislikes. When customers say theyre going to get ice cream at Mikes rather than at a big frozen yogurt chain, theyre making a choice to patronize you rather than a largecorporation.4. Make em laugh.Yes, business is serious. Yes, you have to strive to deliver great quality at a fair price. But when you can get your customers to enjoy themselves, it can be a game changerespecially on social media. Whether you tweet a daily joke or you post a silly picture on Instagram, if you can find ways to get customers to smile at (and share!) your posts, youre likely taking steps toward becoming part of their lifestyle.Can you brainstorm with your staff to create a funny shirt or sticker that also promotes your brand? Can you find ways to interact with customers that may not encourage direct sales, but rather are focused on enhancing their lives? Humor can help strengthen connections among people, and finding a way to incorporate levity into your business can help make customers look forward to doing business with you.5. Be active in your community.While giving back to every charity in your area may be unrealistic, it can be advantageous to select a few visible ways to reach out and do some good. Whether you collect donations for childrens holiday presents or sponsoranimals at a local shelter, finding ways to help your customers identify with your company may pay off in loyalty.Whatever strategies you use to engage with customers, remember that loyalty is about much more than a punch card or an interactive app, though those can be great tools. Loyalty is about making customers feel like theyre part of the family, like theyre invested in your success. If your customers want to see you succeed, theyll often help to make sure it happens.Photo:Christopher Lane",5 Ways to Help Your Business Inspire Customer Loyalty
Developing an influencer marketing campaign has brought family-owned Autumn Olive Farms into the restaurants of renowned chefs.,2016-10-31T13:30:40+00:00,Getting Customers,Marketing & Sales,"[Advertising, Branding, Finding New Customers, Getting Customers, Making a Sale, Marketing & Sales, Sales Pitches]",Getting Customers,Phaedra Hise,"How One Farm Created a Michelin-Grade Influencer Marketing CampaignPhaedra HiseWriter and Editor, Virginia Living, Washington Post, American ExpressI am a lifelong journalist, with a passion for telling vivid and insightful stories about and for successful growth businesses. Creative side gigs include mountain biking and a mouth-watering food photography blog.In mid-October, the Michelin Guide rated Washington, DC-area restaurants for the first time. Twelve won stars, and half of those buy their pork from Autumn Olive Farms, a small family-owned farm in Waynesboro, Virginia. For Autumn Olive Farms, this wasnt accidental, or even luck. It was the successful result of a carefully planned out influencer marketing campaign.Our focus is on chefs and restaurants, says Clay Trainum, who founded Autumn Olive Farms alongside his wife Linda. We didnt have the manpower to do farmers markets and retail. We wanted to be here at the farm developing our genetics and our product. Rather than selling to chefs who might not understand the value of his high-quality, heritage breed product, Trainum decided to build an influencer marketing campaign. This way Autumn Olive Farms could focus on those who already appreciated quality, and then let word of mouth spread from those trendsetters.Trainums process for identifying and reaching key influencers with an influencer marketing campaign started with developing a deep understanding of his target customer.Find the right influencers.To get started with Autumn Olive Farmss influencer marketing campaign, the Trainums studied lists of top restaurants published in DC-area magazines and newspapers. They created a spreadsheet of about a hundred restaurants and then started researching each one. The couple gathered information online about the chefs and their history, background, previous restaurants and menu prices.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Clay Trainum"" alignment=""center""]If theyre not successful with our products, then we arent successful. Its a very intimate relationship.Clay Trainum, co-founder, Autumn Olive Farms[/pullquote]We were looking for compatibility and menu price points that would match the fact that our products are never going to be inexpensive, Trainum says. It made sense to sit at home and do that leg work versus driving to DC to stay in hotels and hoof it up and down the streets. That information helped them narrow the list to the best candidates.Know the customer.I didnt know anything about chefs, Trainum admits. But he had a neighbor who had worked as a chef, sohereached out to him for information. He helped me understand the culture, schedules, preferences and terminology, Trainum says. I wanted to do this correctly and professionally, and there are certain protocols in the kitchen that I needed to know.For example, Trainum learned to call chefs Chef or Chef Danny instead of simply Danny. And he discovered the best times of day to call restaurants. (It depends on whether they serve both lunch and dinner, or dinner only.)Sell on their terms.Trainum understood that chefs are very busy, and often distracted, so it is usually difficult to have their full attention for any length of time. Once he started visiting restaurants, Trainum quickly discovered that sometimes he would only have a few minutes of face timenot an ideal setting for a sales pitch. So, he adapted.We bought an expensive vacuum packer to put together a sample package, Trainum says. We packaged loin, belly [and] other cuts that would give a very attractive visual appearance and reflect the quality of the product.Playing off the stereotype of chefs brashness, Trainum would walk confidently through the back door to the kitchen, ask for the chef and drop off a sample package for them to try. It was a very arrogant thing to do, and they loved that, he says.Elevate customer service.When selling to the top end of any market, having exceptional customer service doesnt hurt. Autumn Olive Farms understood this from day one. If any chef has any problem with product, Trainum says his policy is, You tell us what this has cost you and well issue a credit for that amount. Its an open invitation, he says, for Autumn Olive Farms to cover the cost of product, labor and lost business.Weve only had to do this maybe six to eight times in 10 years, Trainum says. Nobody has ever abused it.In fact, Trainum has had customers tell him to simply replace the product without any additional credit. He and Linda drove from Waynesboro to DC to make the delivery that same day.Build a true partnership.By developing such a deep understanding of his top customers with his influencer marketing campaign, Trainum has also learned important ways to tweak his product for them. For example, when chefs asked for higher meat yields with slightly less fat, Trainum developed a cross-breed pig especially for that market.If theyre not successful with our products, then we arent successful, he says. Its a very intimate relationship.That close partnership works both ways. This past spring, when Autumn Olive Farms lost litters of piglets to bad weather and predators, customers didnt fret over the dwindling supply of pork. Rather than demand priority delivery of their preferred cuts, many of Trainums Michelin-starred chefs told him, Just bring us the cuts you need to bring us and well make it work.Trainum is quick to credit his customers, praising them for dedication, hard work, long hours and appreciation of quality. But the truth is that he works the same wayand that work ethic has helped laid the groundwork to build valuable trust among his key influencers for long-term success.Read more articles on getting customers.Photo: iStock",How One Farm Created a Michelin-Grade Influencer Marketing Campaign
Facebook has made it easier for businesses to create lead-generating ads. Here's how you can dip your toe into Facebook marketing.,2016-11-08T13:30:55+00:00,Getting Customers,Marketing & Sales,"[Advertising, Facebook, Getting Customers, Marketing & Sales]",Getting Customers,Glen Stansberry,"How Facebook Marketing May Help You Reach Highly Targeted LeadsGlen StansberryCo-founder, GentlemintHi there, you can call me Glen. Im Co-founder at Gentlemint and Im based in Lawrence, Kansas Area.Online ads have come a long way in the last few years. Gone are the days of needing an expensive ad agency to create effective ads for your business. Ad networks like Google Adwords and Facebook marketing havehelped lower the barrier for creating profitable ads.You, dearbusiness owner, could create an ad in 15 minutes that could generate actual leads for your business. The best part is that, with Facebook marketing, you can test this process for as little as $5 a day.The Power of Facebook MarketingFacebook marketing had a significant impact onthe advertising game with their highly-targeted native ads. You dont have to spend hundreds of dollars each day to run a website ad for every visitor. Youre merely having your ads shown to exactly the people you want, and you only pay when someone clicks your ad.When it comes to Facebook marketing (or any other marketing, for that matter), you have to be incredibly specific when targeting an audience. A bigmistake many people make with Facebook ads is not being specific enough with who they want to reach with their ads.Many business owners want to make the most impact from their money, so they try to show their ad to as many people as possible. This can work against you. When it comes to Facebook marketing, more is notnecessarily better.The social media platform cangive you incredibly fine-grained control when it comes to targeting. This audience specificity drives down cost. Facebook rewards ads that are efficient and effective by lowering the cost per click (or action).Step 1: Get in Your Ideal Customers HeadBefore you startthinking about crafting your ad, it helps tofigure out your core demographic first. You can make a quick list of the attributes of your ideal customer:What do they read?What websites do they visit?How old are they?What products do they buy?Where do they shop?What other Facebook pages do they like?Answering these questions (and more if you can) can help as you start shaping what your ideal customer will look like. You can use these attributes to help show your ad to the perfect people using Facebook marketing.Step 2: Define the Specific ActionNow that you know who youre making the ad for, its time to figure out what theyre going to do. What action is your ad going to have them take?This can be a problem with Facebookad campaigns: They lack a specific call to action. Businesses can often underestimate the motivation needed to actually click an ad.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Glen Stansberry"" alignment=""center""]Setting up a Facebook ad is fairly straightforward and doesnt require a huge ad budget or an entire ad team. You can set them up yourself for a few dollars a day. If the ads are profitable, then you can invest more time and money into the process.[/pullquote]If youre trying to get a leads email address, you may want to send them to a subscribe form or lead magnet. If you want people to buy a product, consider sending them to the product page. (Though Facebook ads are generally suited better towards an offer like a coupon or an email signup than selling products.)You may want to avoid just sending them to your homepage. The idea is that once people click on your ad, theyre sent to a page that a) matches the offer they saw in your ad and b) has a clear action for them to take.Step 3: Create an Irresistible OfferIn order for people to click on ad, they need some sort of benefit for clicking it. What are you providing for them? How are you making their lives easier? How are you making them happier?Many businesses believe that people will click on their ads because they like them or find them interesting. Consider this: How many Facebook ads have you clicked on in the last week? Probably less than one.Great ads have an offer that people cant pass up on. Oftentimes a great offer has an incentive like a coupon or a price break, or when it is a time-sensitive offer.Using Facebook Marketing to Create Your AdNow head on over to Facebook Ads website, and you can start building your ad. (Note: Because Facebook often changes the actual steps and process for ad creation, you should follow along with Facebooks own documentation while creating the ad. This article is meant to give you higher-level concepts rather than the actual ad-creation process.)Ad settings.Once youve told Facebook your desired objective, youre going to start telling Facebook who you want to reach. This is where youll use the data that you collected earlier when describing the attributes of your ideal customer.If youre a local business, youll want to give a radius around your business for the location. If youre not a local business or your operate mostly online, then you may want to just target English-speaking countries (or countries that you ship to). You could also use Facebooks Local Awareness Adsif you want to reach people who are physically near your business.Ad targeting.Forthe rest of the targeting options:Gender: Youll probably want to specify a gender, and craft the tone of your ad accordingly.Age: Age is important too, so fill in the ideal age of your customerInterests: Here is where your hard work earlier will pay off. Start plugging in all of those attributes of your ideal customer. Where they shop, what they do for hobbies, other Facebook pages they might like, etc. Remember to be specific, and stay away from generic suggestions that Facebook will try to give you, like Cars.""Potential reach.As youre filling in these details, youll see on the right sidebar an Audience Definition heading. Under that, youll find Potential reach. Youll want to keep this between 500,000 and 1 million. (If youre a local business, dont worry if this number is much lower.)Other settings.Set your budget to $5 a day, or even lower if you need. The goal is to just get data. Id also recommend setting a schedule so that your ads arent running at 3 a.m., unless thats when your ideal customers are going to be awake.Building Your FacebookAdRefer to Facebooks documentation for building the ad. It consists of supplying a URL, an image, headline and description.If you dont have any good graphics for your ad, you can use Canva, which haspre-built social media images for free. Make sure the image stands out. If the image has text on it, the text cant cover more than 20 percent of the image.Because youre just getting started, I would recommend using every placement availablein the Facebook feed or right columnjust to get some initial data. You can always turn specific placements off later if they dont convert.Thats it! Now the important part: sit tight and dont touch anything. Facebook will learn over time the best potential people to see your ad, and it takes a little time for it to figure it out. Consider letting the ad run for at least a few days before you start changing things.You can try split tests of different ads by copying the original and changing only one thing at a time: the title, the picture, the description. Once you start getting data back on what is working, you can eliminate sections of people that arent clicking, and optimize for the ones that are. This can help drive costs down and conversions up even more.After you start seeing some success, you could start using Facebooks retargeting to reach people who have clicked your ad, but didnt finish the objective.If you want to increase your daily spend, consider only increasing by 20 percent every day. Raising your daily spend from $5 a day to $500 could negatively affect Facebooks algorithm for showing your ad to the right people.Setting up a Facebook ad is fairly straightforward and doesnt require a huge ad budget or an entire ad team. You can set them up yourself for a few dollars a day. If the ads are profitable, then you can invest more time and money into the process.Read more articles aboutFacebook.Photo: iStock",How Facebook Marketing May Help You Reach Highly Targeted Leads
"Marketing technology changes rapidlyâ€”and if you keep up, it can spell opportunity for you and your brand to move ahead of the competition.",2016-10-21T20:00:26+00:00,Getting Customers,Customer Relations,"[Content Marketing, Customer Engagement, Customer Relations, Digital Tools, Getting Customers, Marketing & Sales, Websites]",Getting Customers,Gabriel Shaoolian,"5 Digital Marketing Strategies That Can Help Drive Online SalesGabriel ShaoolianFounder &amp; VP of Digital Services, Blue Fountain MediaWith so many digital marketing tactics all aimed at driving online sales, how do you know which are the most cost-effective and efficient? When it comes to driving qualified traffic to help your site produce sales, the following five tactics can be incredibly effective at helping to generate conversions at a low cost.1. Social Media MarketingGoing beyond organic posts and using the advantages of social media marketing can hold many opportunities for your brand online. Today, a companys social media presence is critical to growth, and with the advertising options that are now available, its incredibly easy to reach a targeted audience.Across social platforms like Instagram and Facebook, you can completely tailor your ad content for the platform in an easy manner. Such channels allow you to select different targeting options based on refined demographics, locations, interests, professions and beyond, allowing you to only spend money toward the users that are going to be most interested in your ad content. Best of all, the platforms are cost-per-click, which definitely helps to keep your budget down. And they offer various ad formats, so you can really customize the style you want to serve your audience with.2. Retargeting AdsA second-time visitor has a far higher likelihood of converting than a first-time visitor, so its essential that you reengage users and bring them back to your website. Retargeting ads through programs offered by Google or AdRoll can help you to stay top-of-mind with your users while they consume content elsewhere on the internet.This digital advertising can be incredibly cost-effective too, as you can select an option where you only pay when the user actually clicks through to your site from the ad. By serving users that are already familiar with your brand, youre more likely to reengage them and eventually convert them. Tapping that initial interest is key.3. Email MarketingWhile people receive a ton of promotional emails each day, its likely that the average user doesnt receive that many that are truly interesting and relevant to their needs. With the right email marketing approach, you can easily communicate with users, reengaging them with a valuable message and helping to bring them back to your site.Programs like MailChimp or Constant Contact make it easy to disseminate emails to lists of users. That being said, in order to send emails that garner results, you need to send to the right audience, and creating email lists of users that are interested in your brand can be tricky. The most effective way to capture user interest and increase sign-ups for your e-newsletters may be to really provide an incentive. If youre an e-commerce brand, try offering exclusive deals or special promotions when they sign up for your newsletters. If there is no real value in your email campaigns, then they arent likely to resonate well with users and produce the type of results most brands seek.4. Content MarketingUsers dont want content that fails to serve their needs or that holds no real value. As a brand, if you can produce content that is incredibly relevant to your audience, whether it is a video tutorial or a how-to"" post, you can help engage and capture customer attention.That being said, to effectively create content that resonates with your audience, its critical that you listen to their needs and understand them as users. Without a thorough understanding of who your customers are and what they want to know and receive from your brand, its nearly impossible to foster engagement. Listen to your audience on social media, examine analytics to see which blog posts tend to perform the best and look for opportunities in the marketplace where you can fill a gap with what customers are looking for.Once you have that understanding, leverage your internal experts to create content that showcases your expertise and skills. Create posts that experts at your company can use to highlight their knowledge within your industry, or use design resources to aggregate data to create infographics.5. Responsive DesignLast, but certainly not least, a responsive design is one of the most important digital strategies you can use to help your brand online. Its surprising to see how many brands still dont have a website that is optimized for mobile.A responsive design ensures that regardless of the device users are accessing your site from (mobile, tablet or desktop) they are provided with a website that is optimized for their screen. This type of design renders to fit the screen size, ensuring that users arent faced with any issues in terms of functionality and usability. Whether its buttons that are too big for the screen, or images that require excessive zooming in and out or form fields that are too difficult to type into on mobile, any of these blunders with your design can interfere with visitors converting on your site.To grow your brand online its essential that you focus on a strategic approach to digital marketingand tailor these tactics to help meet the unique needs of your users.Photo: iStock",5 Digital Marketing Strategies That Can Help Drive Online Sales

Not having accurate or loophole-free language can hurt your business. Thatwas the case20 years ago when Pepsi held a contest that famously wound up in court. Pepsi ran an ad that jokingly suggested if you collected enough points in their contest, you could win a jet.

It should be to build your email list,"" says Ajay Paghdal, a co-founder and the CEO for Youth Noise, an SEO firm in San Francisco.But, of course, there could be other viable goals in mind.""The purpose for contests sponsored by small businesses is usually to drive public relations, increase Facebook fans, increase customers, generate customer leads,"" says Angela Zade, a Las Vegas-based digital analyst for seoWorks, an SEO firm with offices around the world.5.Decideif running a contest is even beneficial to your company.Entering contests can be fun, but running them isnt always as much of a blast, according to Zade.After all, it can be costly, what with attorneys, the expense of the prize or prizes and the extra customer service required to handle enthusiastic or demanding patrons. Maybe thats looking at the glass as half empty, but running a contest can take up time and resources you may not be prepared to utilize.Thats why Zade says that you might find that even if the results are positive, you will nonetheless end up remembering the strife far more than the outcome of the contest.And its why Mitch Goldstone, CEO ofIrvine, California-basedScanMyPhotos.com, says that his best tip for running a contest is, ""Dont.""""Beyond the legal and other costs of hosting a contest, from my experiences, they are a horrible waste of time and showcase the wrong perception of your business,"" Goldstone says.

Im Founder at The Ruhlin Group and Im based in Greater St. Louis Area.Becoming an industry expert may have a profound impact on your business and your bottom line.I worked as a distributor while going to college. The company president was invited to be the main speaker at a large agricultural business event. The topic was selling, but asan executive, he waslong removed from thesales department. So he asked his top North American distributor to speak with him on stage.That distributor was me.That experience changed my life. By the time I walked off stage, I had earned my first real credential as an expert. Not bad for a farm boy from Ohio.Networking is important, but its not enough to just fill your pockets with business cards. Creating valuable connections can start with building trust, and expertise can form the foundation of that trust.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Bring a perfectionist attitude to your company. I make sure everything our clients see from our company is 500 percent better than they would expect, including simple correspondence.[/pullquote]The Value of Becoming an ExpertWhen the right people like and trust you, their fear bubbles will likely pop. They may give themselves permission to let down their guard and engage you. This is when big dealsmaystart happening, and your business can take off.As you build a network of advocates who admire and respect your expertise, the referrals may come pouring in. Deals can get bigger and maygo more smoothly. People may also come to you for advice and mentorship. All sorts of other opportunities may float your way, like the chance to partner with a nonprofit, contribute to a publication or join a board.A few weeks after my speaking opportunity, a marketing director for a mid-sized seed company who had been in the audience asked me to put together a program for the companys top 1,600 prospects. It was one of the largest campaigns at that point in my career. That man also became a great friend of mine, brought me in on many other deals and even introduced me to my wife.Turning yourself into an expert usually doesnt happen that smoothly, but you may accomplish the sameby consistently putting yourself at the forefront of your industry in well-executed ways.How to PositionYourself asan Industry ExpertMy speech was only the start of a campaign to position myself as an expert in the realms of relationship development, C-level sales and strategic gifting. Its an ongoing process that requires focus, commitment and a variety of strategies, including:Writing articles for industry publications.In the age of the Internet, it may be easier than ever to find publications looking for new content. Start small by posting as a guestin niche industry blogs. Then, consider using those credits to pitch to larger publications. Make sure your articles are world-class. If you have the resources, consider hiring a content marketing company to cut your time and increase your placement rate.Publishing a book.This one can require a big time commitment (even if you hire a ghostwriter), but its often worth the effort. I was fortunate to collaborate on the bestselling book,Cutting Edge Sales.My position as an author definitely impresses clients, vendors and others.Speaking at industry events.Apply for speaking opportunities atthe types of events your ideal clients or potential connections would attend. Focus on turning yourself into a dynamic, fluid and engaging speaker who can connect deeply with your audiences. If this doesnt come naturally, consider hiring a speaking coach or someone who can give candid feedback.Focusing on the details. Showcase your expertise in everything you do. Bring aperfectionist attitude to your company. I make sure everything our clients see from our company is 500 percent better than they would expect, including simple correspondence.

When you associate with a company that others respect and admire, you might bask in its halo and earn big trust points. Dont be afraid to pitch to the big guns in your industry.Developing yourself as an expert can be significantly lucrative for businesses of any size, but it can be especially useful to small-business owners who cant afford multimillion-dollar PR campaigns.

Small Business Saturday, which falls on November 26th this year,was founded by American Express in 2010 and has gained serious momentum since its launch. According to a consumer survey commissioned by American Express and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), more than95 million consumers shopped on Small Business Saturdayin 2015, spending around $16.2 billion total at independent retailers and restaurants across the U.S.1 More than 4,100 Neighborhood Champions rallied local businesses in 2015 and created events around the day.So how can your business get the word out to customers about the importance of shopping small on Small Business Saturday and beyond? These three entrepreneurs share ideas on how they help foster their local communities all year long.Ledbury: Crafting Luxury Shirts With an Eye on Local CommunityIt was September 2008 when Paul Trible and Paul Watson knew their careers were in for a change. Both were living in England, having just graduated from the University of Oxford, and both had jobs waiting for them.The pair had often talked about their love for the tailored shirts readily available in the U.K. Instead of starting the jobs theyd lined up, they decided to start a shirt-making business in the U.S.Ledbury founders Paul Watson (left) and Paul Trible discuss shirt designsat their flagship store in Richmond, Virginia.In December 2009, they moved to Richmond, Virginia, and foundedLedbury, a mens luxury apparel company. Business took off and today there are two locations in Richmond and one in Washington, D.C. Nearly 80 percent of their business is online, with 95 percent of that from outside the greater Richmond area, according to the founders.The concept of community has been at the center of Ledburys mission from day one. It has always been about the local story,"" says Trible. When we started marketing the business, we realized we could tell the story of Paul and I, or it could be a richer conversation where we include friends and places we interact with on a regular basis.""Ledburys websitefeaturesstories of local artists, chefs and entrepreneurs.The pair started telling stories of local artists, chefs and entrepreneurs on their website. In each photo, the featured subject would wear a Ledbury shirt. Today, Ledbury has more than 100,000 people on its email and newsletter list, according to the founders. The company also hosts oneweekend-long quail hunt each year where they bring in customers, vendors and investors along for the fun. To help build buzz in the past, Ledbury has hosted social media contests to give customers a chance to win a free trip to the hunt.Ledbury has participated in Small Business Saturday since 2010 and plans to continue indefinitely. We get the word out on social media and keep longer hours at the stores,"" says Trible. We also do promotions. It definitely drives foot traffic.""Bw Kafe: Brewing Coffee to Bring Relief to HaitiMore than 300 miles north of Richmond in Hoboken, New Jersey, sitsBw Kafe, a coffee shop that sells Haitian coffee and features Haitian-inspired art, run by Dale Ryan and her brother, Evan Ryan. The store opened in May 2013 as a spin-off project of a nonprofit their mother started to help victims of Haitis 2010 earthquake.Part of our profits go toLove for Haiti,the charity our mom started, says Dale, adding that every coffee blend includes beans from Haiti and the space is decorated with indigenous art from Haiti.Bw Kafe founder Dale Ryan prepares a drink at the businesssHoboken, New Jersey location.Business has been good from the start for the sibling co-owners and in November 2015, they opened a second location in Jersey City. Along with its philanthropic mission, the Ryans are dedicated to fostering a sense of place, starting with a 10-foot-long community table"" in the center of both cafes.Strangers sit next to each other and enjoy coffee; weve had two marriages come out of people who met at that table,"" Dale says. We also use the table to host community events at no charge. Right now we have a weekly French class. [In the past] weve had a meditation workshop, an essential oils workshop and other events.""Artwork and crafts decorate the walls ofBw Kafe.Bw Kafe jumped at the opportunity to participate in Small Business Saturday back in 2013 when theyd been open just six months. It reminds people that they dont have to go far to get unique gifts for the holidays,"" says Dale, adding that every year they put up marketing materials around the store for Small Business Saturday and offer gift baskets at 10 percent off. This year, we are going to put together more packages for our customers and incorporate some Haitian crafts,"" she says.Journeys of Life: Selling Soulful Gifts in PittsburghAnother 350 miles west of Hoboken on Bellefonte Street in the Shadyside district of Pittsburgh isJourneys of Life, a bookstore and gift shop for people with a variety of spiritual and religious belief systems. Local Jean Haller founded the shop in 1989 to provide items for people who are on a path or a way to something,"" she says. Many of her customers are recovering from hardships while others are looking for items to cheer up a friend who might be down.Journeys of Life founder Jean Haller opened her bookstore and gift shopover 20 years ago in PittsburghsShadyside district.From the day she opened, Haller worked hard to build a community around her, donating time and resources to nonprofits in her areafrom a school for at-risk youth to an animal rescue to womens organizations. A few years ago, that community showed up for her in an unexpected way.At 3 a.m. on November 13, 2011, her phone rang and she was informed that an electrical fire had destroyed her store. I was the Neighborhood Champion for my area and it was two weeks until Thanksgiving,"" she remembers. I had to do something.""Hallers community gathered around her and helped her open an interim location in a matter of days. That Small Business Saturday was one for the books. I couldnt believe how many people came into the store,"" she says.

She is the author of Presenting with Credibility (2012) and The Leader as a Mensch (2009). Bruna has helped thousands of individuals become more effective communicators. www.clarionenterprises.comNamed a Forbes Top 50 Social Media Power Influencer two years in a row, Neal Schaffer is a leading social media strategist. He is the founder of Maximize Your Social, a social media strategy consulting company. In addition to having authored several books on social media, Schaffer is the founder of the Social Tools Summit, a social media conference that focuses on best social media practices and technology.Schaffer and I talked more aboutways business owners can useTwitter marketing to advance their goals. (You canread the first half of our conversation here.)A few months ago, you had 137K followers on Twitter. I see that you now have 153K. What do you credit your success to?I suppose a growth of 3,000 a month is pretty significant. But on the other hand, its a growth of two percent a month.If you were at 100 followers, your growth ratio should be a lot higher per month. Once you get to over 1,000 that number is going to slow down. On Twitter, as with a lot of social media, the larger the number of followers you have, the more followers you attract. People see large numbers and they want to follow because they think theres value. Now I dont recommend you buy fake followers. But I do recommend that you try to create additional reach where it makes sense to do so. If youre the largest in your industry, theres no reason to do that. But if you have competitors that are larger than you, you can obviously target their followers and try to win some of those followers over to become part of your community.The other reason my number of followers has increased is [because] recently I got verified by Twitter. Perhaps that verification may have helped in increasing followers.Ive also increased my frequency in sharing content that I curated and vettedcontent that I think has a lot of value to other marketers and social media marketers. Publishing at a certain frequencyis one of the latest ways that seasoned Twitter users can step up their Twitter marketing efforts. It helps you get found by more people that are searching Twitter randomly.The other thing that Ive done is Twitter chats. They definitely can help to be found by a lot of new people.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Neal Schaffer"" alignment=""center""]I think that if youre in the mindset that social media should be free and youre not ready to invest a few thousand dollars a month in social media...you would really need to manage your expectations as to what youre going to get out of social media, in all honesty.Neal Schaffer, social media expert[/pullquote]I also follow a lot of people every day. Some people just wont follow anyone back. They have 5,000 followers but they only follow 100 people. Its going to restrict the number of followers you can get unless youre a famous celebrity.Youve got to send social signals.So I curate a lot of content, I re-tweet a lot of content, and I follow a lot of people. I think its really been a combination of those things that has helped me attract new followers.Are there any new or underused tools and features for Twitter marketing?Id say Twitter Cards. Twitter Cards are something you can use once you open a Twitter advertising account, and you can use them without even advertising.You can create a Twitter Card and ads that you use for a campaign. ATwitter ad creates a URL that you can link to in any of your tweets and attach a Card. The Card will allow people to opt into things a lot easier by automatically grabbing their email addresses or names.I still think that Twitter ads, and all the different things you can do with Twitter ads, are underutilized but that goes beyond the scope of this interview. Theres obviously a lot of things you can do. I know from the source that Twitter advertising is starting beta for some other exciting things as well. So if you havent been into Twitter ads recently, I recommend that you check it out and explore the options.What are your favorite Twitter tools?There are a lot of Twitter tools I recommend. Its really hard to create a short list, but just thinking of the tools that I use a lot with Twitter, one would be Sprout Social. This is sort of my go-through, go-to dashboard.I use eClincher, which is a great tool that helps me categorize my posts, as well as helps me republish content that I want to republish selectively.Social Champ is a sort of up-and-coming tool that Ive not used yet, but that I plan to use. Its another great tool which allows you to republish content. Its been evangelized by Guy Kawasaki.MarketHub is a great tool which allows me to engage by sharing other peoples content.BuzzSumo is also a great tool to help you find content to curate. Its not just limited to Twitter, it goes beyond Twitter.Social Quant is a great Twitter follower management tool.If we go onto more, like, enterprise tools, I would mention something like Little Bird or a Traackr, which is more of an influencer marketing tool. It allows you to analyze who you should be following for any given industry.What are the best times to tweet for maximum engagement?This is going to be different for every single company, based on their target audience and based on whos following them. So once again, its going to come down to experimenting, just like you experiment with optimizing your content. Are there times of the day, or days of the week, where you seem to be getting more engagement than others?In my experience, I find that Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the time zone of the area that youre targeting, seems to bring the most engagement for me and my clients. And thats a very broad generalization. But I will say Monday to Friday seems to get more engagement. Thats the time when people are starting work or maybe its before they go home. I do believe those times are great. But it doesnt mean you should ignore late night or Saturdays and Sundays. These are times when theres less supply, and, therefore, you might have a greater chance for engagement. Experiment with a few different dates [and] times and go from there. Let the data lead you to the truth that youre seeking.Marketing on social media can be very time-consuming. What are some strategies for Twitter marketing that can helpbusy business owners save time and still be effective?Well, people dont scale. And Im a big proponent of this. I do a lot of talking about social media operations because of this fact.You have three choices:Either youre going to make the investment of time to do it rightand thats not what you should be doing unless youre in the business of social media.Or youre going to leverage paid social and maybe use tools like the ones I mentioned to help you scale and do more with less.Or youre going to outsource your Twitter marketing to someone else, or hire an assistant to do that for you.I dont think there are any other ways of doing it. I launched my social media agency recently. I work with a lot of large companies, as well as startups and entrepreneurs. You truly get what you pay for and time is money. I think that if youre in the mindset that social media should be free and youre not ready to invest a few thousand dollars a month in social media, whether it be working with an agency, or investing in social advertisements, you would really need to manage your expectations as to what youre going to get out of social media, in all honesty.I know organic success still happens, but its getting harder and harder. Its supply and demand. Too many people, too much content, limited timeline space. And it goes the same for Facebook or any other social network.For more tips on finding new customers, download our exclusive guide from Guy Kawasaki, The Art of Getting Customers.Read more articles on social media strategy.Photo: iStock",3 Twitter Marketing Practices for Growing Followers That Neal Schaffer Swears By

He is the author of three social media books, including Maximize Your Social: A One-Stop Guide to Building a Social Media Strategy for Marketing and Business Success. As a social media consultant and international speaker, Schaffer helps companies and professionals become more successful at using social media to market their business.Recently, I had the pleasure of interviewing Schaffer on how business owners can maximize their Twitter marketing.Neal SchafferWhat advice can you give business owners who want to use Twittermarketing for their business?Its important to have a very clear objective as to why youre using Twitter. Social media strategy, as I wrote in Maximize Your Social, begins with that objective. You need to be very clear because, ideally, its where youre going to lead people. Thats going to be the link in your bio. If you want to generate leads, that link goes maybe to an e-book, a webinar or a white paper. If you want to make more sales, that link maybe goes to your product catalog or a special discount for Twitter followers. Whatever it is, thats what you begin with.Next, you need to think about engaging with others using your content. Ask yourself, what is the information that my target customers would be looking for if they were searching on Twitter, rather than Google? What makes my target customers tick? Where do they go for information, i.e. who might they be following on Twitter? Once you figure that out, you begin to create your content strategy for Twitter.Asking yourself those core things are going to really help you create a great content strategy. This will allow you to start sharing different types of content and seeing what people engage with. Sharing content regularly on Twitter is a necessity to build a community over time and get noticed.After you do that, its important to look at the frequency of your tweeting. Try to categorize your content to see what performs better on Twitter and optimize over time. If you get constant engagement and, more important, you begin to see positive trends in your activity from Twitter back to your website, increase your posting frequency to see if it will further increase website activity. If you follow these instructions, youre going to get a lot more engagement than you could organically on Facebook, whose EdgeRank algorithm to determine what appears in the News Feed is much more severe than what Twitter has.You also need to consider spending on an advertising budget on Twitter. And I say that because the days of just organically tweeting and getting found are gone. The bigger you become on Twitter, the more organic leads and conversions you mayget. I would highly recommend creating a budget thats going to help you create a targeted community, to begin with. It will help your community and others on Twitter not only find you over time, but also find those promotions that you want people to discover when youre tweeting.What are some of the most effective ways to directly engage with various audiences on Twitter?Twitter gives you the ability to send what I like to call ""social signals."" With a Facebook page or a LinkedIn company page, you really cant engage with others unless they engage with you. After all, you cant friend someone from your Facebook page, right?But you can do this on Twitter. And what I mean by this is you can follow anyone you want. Theres no difference between a company page and a personal profile. And its the same for Instagram which makes them very exciting platforms for social media marketers. So, theres a lot of different ways to engage with your Twitter audience. Following your target audience is one way of engaging with them. Re-tweeting their content is obviously another way. Proactively reaching out to them and reactively responding when they reach out to you is another thing to do to engage with them.I dont think one way is more effective than others. Twitter gives you the tools to do more than you can on other more rigid social networks. So it comes down to understanding the fundamental difference between Twitter and Facebook or LinkedIn, leveraging that and really humanizing your social media and engaging on Twitter as if youre a person. Because Twitter allows you to do that. And every business should be taking advantage of all those different social signals that are at their disposal.What are your top tips for making good use of Twitter analytics?The first is to categorize your content. I categorize my content in a few different ways. One thing I like to do is to hashtag my content according to different subjects that I want to publish content on, that Ive written books on or that I want to be known for as an expert. So it could be #Instagram, it could be #LinkedIn; it could be #influencermarketing or #socialselling.Now I can go in Twitter analytics and compare and contrast my content categories. I like to export 30 days worth of content to see how its doing, and I like to do different sorts to see how my tweets are doing. You can look at ""reach"" or ""mentions."" I like ""clicks."" I think clicks is the ultimate thing that many businesses will be most interested in, especially smaller businesses that are just starting their Twitter marketing efforts. And now I can analyze what types of content are getting the most and the least amount of clicks and what my community is just not engaging in. I can then decide if I should just stop publishing some type of content altogether on Twitter.This is necessary to become more effective in your content publishing on Twitter. So thats really my number one top tip.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Neal Schaffer"" alignment=""center""]Sharing content regularly on Twitter is a necessity to build a community over time and get noticed.[/pullquote]You can use Twitter analytics to delve into more detail on ""What time of day should I tweet?"" etc., but I try not to get lost in the weeds. Obviously, for larger companies, there are analytics platforms like Simply Measured that will save you a lot of time, and even social media dashboards like Sprout Social will give you analytics [that]will help you save time and be revealing.Really try to use Twitter analytics to find out what type of content is the most engaging. Let that lead you to optimize your content strategy on Twitter. But dont go overboard on all the details and get lost in the weeds!What are the latest ways seasoned Twitter users can step up their Twitter marketing efforts?I think that the most seasoned Twitter users will try to do a combination of things. They will accelerate the frequency of publishing. And this becomes the challenge. What it comes down to is being able to curate enough content if you dont have enough published content yourself to be able to publish more frequently.I think another thing that seasoned Twitter users do in order to help bridge that gap is to republish content that they have already republished in the past, at a certain frequency, to get more engagement for that same content. It can be their own content. It can be curated content. The reason behind that is not everybody on Twitter is looking at the same content at the same time. And thats why its critical to experiment with republishing content. Maybe its just every month you republish the same content. But I think thats something that you should be looking to do if want to step up your Twitter marketing efforts.Another tactic is to frequently follow more people. Maybe youve only been following 10 people a day. Increase that to 20 people a day, or 50, or even 100, whatever it is. Once again, consider increasing the frequency of your activities on Twitter.The other thing that I would look at is Twitter ads. You can really leverage the custom audience capability that Twitter ads provide you. Make sure you have the tracking and conversion pixels installed on your website. Twitter provides a snippet of code that you can embed in the HTML of a website. Be sure youre measuring conversions. Also, ensure that youre uploading your email data and that youre utilizing those custom audiences. Experiment with re-targeting campaigns, experiment with campaigns to your email database in addition to just good old Twitter campaigns. Try to seethrough A, B, C testinghow you can get more for your Twitter marketing budget using Twitter ads. As you can see, I am a big fan of Twitter ads and my clients have found immense value in them.I see a variety of Twitter Chats sprouting. What are one or two you would recommend for business owners who want to engage in Twitter marketing?Theres a great one called #TwitterSmarter that you should look at. Also look at #SproutChat. Those are two that I would definitely recommend. Theres tons of them out there, though. Its not limited to just those two. Do a search for your industry of different keywords and different hashtags. Over the course of time, youre probably going to find out about a chat that one of your competitors might be hosting for your industry.Twitter chats are really great ways to network and get your message out to a lot of people that may not be following you, but might see your content because theyre following the hashtag of the Twitter chat.Check back next week for more of Neal Schaffers tips on how to effectively use Twitter for your business.Read more articles on Twitter.Photo: iStock,courtesy of Neal Schaffer",Neal Schaffer on How to Help Take Your Twitter Marketing to the Next Level

She was frustrated with the lack of products that helped her hair weather the humidity, and had time on her hands.Get Set Hair Jelly was made and continues to be one of my best-sellers, she says. After listening to my customers and the market, I added products until I had a full product line. She founded Wonder Curl in 2010, and incorporated in 2012.We strive to make the world a better place by giving our customers great hair days, she says.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]We strive to make the world a better place by giving our customers great hair days.[/pullquote]1. How has your business grown?For about three and a half years, I was running my business as a side hustle while working a full-time job. I used that job to learn as much as I could as a marketing manager while also using it to fund my business. After my full-time job found out that I was running a business on the side, they let me go. I decided that this was a gift and not a setback and decided this was the right time to focus on my business and to take it to the next level.I have been running my business full time for over two years now. Since I started in my sisters kitchen, I now have a lab on retainer to test products and work with me on R&D, I have a salesperson on commission to take the business into new markets as well as manufacturing capabilities that I didnt have before.In 2017, I plan on focusing on more wholesale opportunities. People want products when they run out and to be able to go to their local shop to grab them will be the difference between growth and remaining stagnant.Wonder Curl owner and founder Scarlett Rocourt2. What hurdles have you overcome?Going from being a kitchen chemist to finding the right manufacturing partner was tough. I was in that in-between stage of my business. I got my first large order from a major distributor and trying to find a manufacturer that would take a chance on my business as well as partner with me in helping my growth has been a challenge. I have finally found a company that has the capability to work on small batches without breaking the bank while also being able to scale up.3. What has been your most memorable moment?Three years ago, I was giving a free demonstration at a hair show in the auditorium at a hotel in Philadelphia. When I go to the room, all of the seats were filled, with some people standing in the back. I was almost finished with my demo when a woman in the front, with very tightly curled hair, was skeptical about how my products would work on her hair. I accepted her challenge and sat her on the stage and began to work the products into her hair. As soon as her curls started to form, half the room got up and ran to my booth. I sold out of everything in minutes, including the testers.4. What challenges do you face inthe beauty industry?Women with curly hair are usually on the lookout for the holy grail of products and tend to be product junkies. Grabbing their attention and turning them into loyal customers has been my biggest challenge, especially when there are newer product lines from existing companies entering the market almost every day. I overcome these challenges by staying aware of who my biggest competitors are and continuing to spread the message that Wonder Curls products do what they say and live up to the hype. With my products, the way your hair looks wet is how it will look when it dries, and it lasts for many days.5. What are three things you cant live without?Since Im growing my hair out and Im in that dreaded in-between stage, I have to have my scarf to pull my hair back into a poof when I dont feel like doing anything to it.Green smoothies. I make a huge batch of this with kale, spinach, Swiss chard, banana and strawberries. I refrigerate the smoothies in mason jars so that I can grab and go in the mornings on my way to the office.I am not one of those people who can function on four hours of sleep. I need seven to eight hours in order to be at my best and to make quick decisions. There are two things that I dont ever take for granted my health and my curls.Photos:iStock, Courtesy ofMark A.

We connect local businesses to an increasingly mobile workforce. His vision for Workform, founded in 2014, is helping to support a major shift in our society.People who work beyond an office, outside of the 9 to 5, may be growing in number, as are co-working spaces and cafes targeting the remote workforce, but it can be difficult to find those places, especially when traveling. Workfromconnects workers with those places, and adds a social aspect to keep everyone connected.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]The new way to work is being built by a new type of professional. Freelancers, office escapees and remote employees are mastering productivity while rejecting the idea that personal betterment, family, travel and health are things you only focus on after a long day at the office.[/pullquote]For more than a century, weve built infrastructure aimed at supporting office professionals and their norms, he says. Business parks, boxing in rows of office buildings, sprung to life in every suburb. Freeways, highways, one ways and subways funnel people through daily commutes like veins during stop-and-go training at the gym.Weve built cultural norms like happy hours to take advantage of the great migration that comes at the end of a traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday. Was there a rush hour before we had an office to rush to?1. Why did you start your business?I started my business because great work increasingly happens elsewhere, anywhere and everywhere. Office 1.0 is dying. Office 2.0 is an ever-evolving mix of local coffee shops, kitchen tables, co-working venues and a growing group of spaces offering Wi-Fi and accessible power outlets. This medley of workspaces is already incubating the next game-changing ideas. Companies are taking root in this patchwork quilt of workable space.The new way to work is being built by a new type of professional. Freelancers, office escapees and remote employees are mastering productivity while rejecting the idea that personal betterment, family, travel and health are things you only focus on after a long day at the office. Or worse, only in retirement. I saw an opportunity to help people do their best work wherever they roam, and help coffee shops, cafes, libraries and even bars better leverage the global macro trend.2. How has your business grown?A key part of our business is bringing workable spaces online, from small mom-and-pop shops and neighborhood cafes to companies with satellite locations across continents. We do that through crowdsourcing spaces to get work done in cities and towns all over the world.Starting with Portland, Oregon, we now have coverage in over 1,200citiesdomestic and international. Using Workfrom, you can find great spots to get work done on six of the seven continents. Our community has grown to over 27,000 registered users, and more than twice that use our platform monthly.We plan to continue growth through strategic brand, channel and API partnerships, launching our iOS and Android apps, organic search performance and advertising on traditional social media. Our service provider affiliate tools will be launched soon, helping to grow another side of our platform.Making money was never our number one focus; we created Workfrom to solve an unmet need. With our growing user base, weve found that businesses are interested in advertising their spaces and services, sponsoring events and gaining access to our community so they can learn more about the people theyd like to serve.3. When did you first realize your company was successful?Success can look very different among companies. For me, I knew Workfrom was a success the first time I approached someone working at a coffee shop in NYC to tell them about Workfrom and their response was I found this space on Workfrom today and thats why Im here right now. I love Workfrom.The funny thing about solving a real problem for people is you get very authentic responses when talking about how youre doing it. Early on, I was able to reach out to every person who joined Workfrom to send a personal thank you. I told them how genuinely excited I was they took the time to sign up and I asked if theyd be kind enough to share Workfrom with three other people who could benefit from what were doing. The responses were nothing short of amazing. Ive met thousands of people from all over the world who have the same problems as us, and are just as excited about our community and platform as I am.At some point I couldnt keep up with the signups and I was forced to automate some of the outreach. But I still thank people every chance I get and theyre still just as excited to help.4. What are challenges you face in thecrowded space aimed at remote workers?Were not looking for a blue ocean. In fact, the more people and businesses that get involved with remote work, the merrier.Other spaces areactually our potential partners, not competitors. Were a global community, and because we offer an aggregate search function for professionals to find workspaces anywherebased on a wide variety of criteriathat includes any of these places, and more. We have ice cream shops, hotel lobbies, brew pubs, airport lounges, apartment rooftops and even a park listed on Workfrom. In a truly office-optional economy, having inside knowledge of all the nearby work-friendly spaces at your fingertips is essential.5. Whats the biggest pain point in selling the services you offer?We live in a time of information overload; our professional and personal existences are punctuated by notifications and obligations and lost logins. Getting people over the hurdle of adding yet another tech option isnt easy. We did our best internally to design a platform that is easy, super informative and fun to use.With that in mind, Workfrom is experiential. Were not the Amazon that people go to by default. They have to try us out first. When they do, weve found that its best to show them rather than tell them why our product/app will not only make their lives easier, itll make them better. That boils down to a core focus on our audience and their needs. And its something we cant do alone.Gaining trust, securing critical feedback and investing in building a robust remote community since day one has paid dividends and continues to, even as our team grows.Photo: Courtesy of Darren Buckner",Featured Member: Workfrom CEO Darren Buckner

Im Writer at Entrepreneur Media and Im based in San Francisco Bay Area.Having a hectic lifestyle, working around the clock and constantly traveling doesnt mean Ihaveto subsist on fast food or miss out on exercise. It just means I have to organize, plan and commit to being healthy. Here are some of my personal tips for helping maintain a healthy lifestyle on the go.I take water everywhere I go.Staying hydrated keeps me alert and refreshed, plus the water fills me up, so I tend not to reach for junk food or sodas. Being dehydrated may fool you into thinking youre hungry. When I take walks or go for a bike ride, I use a clip to attach a bottle to my jeans or shorts. I also make sure I take water along with me when I travel.

This way, I can enjoy a well-balanced meal that takes just minutes to unwrap and heat, so I am not tempted by the office pizza and donuts. Ive worked toward changing our office vending machines to provide healthier choices and offer meal plans and cafeteria selections that reflect a more balanced diet. I realize Im not the only person constantly on the go, so that may help to make healthy food accessible. When traveling, I make sure toknow whats nearby so I can pick up some healthy snacks, including trail mix or dried/fresh fruit. If Im dining out, I just focus on moderation.I exercise no matter where I am.I take short breaks throughout the day to walk, or I take a longer break to fit in a workout at the gym. I schedule these as I would schedule a meeting or conference call to make sure I stick to them. Its easy to get caught up in work and deadlines. But then you risk getting no exercise, which doesnt do a bodyor mindgood at all. Of course, this becomes more challenging when I travel and spend more time on planes and at conferences, in meetings and in hotel rooms. I book hotels that have a swimming pool and/or gym equipment so I can schedule that very necessary exercise, whether its at midnight or 5 a.m.. Even if there are no exercise facilities, you can still do some exercises in your hotel room.I try to structure my day as much as possible.This keeps my body trained to eat and exercise at certain times of the day so I never get too hungry and start reaching for those M&Ms. Scheduling a healthy lifestyle makes it a mindful approach to everything I do and gets me to stop what Imdoing and focus on activitieshealthy eating and exercisethat are just as important as those emails, conference calls or blog posts. That schedule doesnt need to crash and burn just because Im on the road. While there are time changes to account for, I try to stick as closely to the existing eating and exercising time as possible no matter where I am in the world. Its important to make this a habit so you dont find excuses like Im too busy or Something came up and I had to cut somewhere. When those mentally start to take over, your healthy lifestyle quickly goes out the window.I get plenty of sleep.I am a morning, afternoon and night person. I am high energy and cram in as much as possible. When I dont get as many hours of sleep as I would have liked, I have been known to take a few power naps. Even short bursts of sleep canbenefit my memory, creativity and productivity. Longer periods of sleep may also train your brain to keep a tight leash on cortisol, the stress hormone that might act like that devil on your shoulder and encourage you to grab that donut or hit that drive-thru.I make time for fun with friends and family.Ahealthy lifestyle is often one where joy, laughter, diversion and great memories are being made. Whether its a night out with my wife or a weekend with the family or friends, I schedule this free time so I can focus on something besides work. By letting go, I actually end up coming up with more ideas than if I had just spent night and day solely on work-related things. Building strong bonds with others may be critical to a healthy lifestyle.I focus on creating purpose and meaning through goal setting.I havean always-growing bucket list of things I want to accomplish. Not only does the list add excitement and keep me in a happy place, but designing my life and accomplishing that design is satisfying in a way that I can feel emotionally and physically. It keeps me going, because theres always something to run toward.I did not accomplish this healthy lifestyle overnight or by snapping my fingers. It took time, effort and determination. There may also be times where I need to reevaluate and restart, but the important part is never giving up on it.John Rampton(@johnrampton) is the founder of Palo Alto, California-basedDue, afree online invoicing company specializing in helping businesses bill their clients easily online.

Need to hire during the holidays?

I sat down with Tina Guth, managing director of PAX Resources, a nationwide recruiting firm specializing in placing senior and C-level candidates in technology and marketing. She offers her advice on recruiting new employees during the holidays.If youre ready to hire, grab a notepad for her not-to-be-missed insights.What are the biggest challenges employers face when recruiting new employees during the holiday season?During the holiday season, many people think hiring comes to a halt. This is actually an excellent time of year to hire. However, the biggest challenge employers face is urgencynot only in their hiring process, but understanding [that] candidates are not remaining on the market long. In technology-related positions, 10days or less is the average time a developer may be on the market.If companies are going to recruit new employees during the holiday season, what do their internal hiring teams need to be aware of to ensure the interview and hiring process keeps moving?Timelines, calendars and availability are essential to keeping the process moving.Know when your key hiring authorities are available so you can keep the process flowing and respectful, as candidates may or may not have greater flexibility at this time of yearespecially if they are covering for others on vacation.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Tina Guth"" alignment=""center""]No matter what your competition is doing, make sure you are recruiting. Talented people are not staying on the market for long and many will be looking for new opportunities.Tina Guth, managing director,PAX Resources[/pullquote]The interview process may also need to be revised if it is too lengthy. Consolidate by opting for conference or Skype calls or add video so multiple hiring authorities can view a single interview and make decisions faster. Also its important for internal recruiters to understand the costs incurred due to projects being put on hold because the hiring process is elongated. It all goes back to the sense of urgency.What have you found are three practices that lead companies to recruiting more successful candidates?Potential candidates want to know about the company brand and culture. Whats the reality of working within this organization? People want to work for companies with which they can align and share their mission. Be transparent in the interview process as to the experience and culture of the organization.Candidates also want to know more about the people theyll be working for and with. For example, what kind of mentor [will] this person be? What values will they gain? What training [will] they receive to enhance their careers? How will the candidate be able to add value to the organization? This information needs to be made clear during the process as a candidate not only wants to know what the company will provide but how they will be able to contribute in a meaningful way.While you hear this frequently, the truth is an exceptional candidate experience is crucial. Should the interview not lead to employment, you should still want to make sure candidates hold your company in a positive light.Posting jobs and hoping for good candidates no longer works, and some social media can be a waste of valuable time. You should develop a strong network with people in various areas for which your company needs talent. For example, if you need technical talent or marketing experts, get to know more of these people outside of your office. Join their organizations. Engage them so that when you have an opening, you know who and where to find the people you want and need. This can be challenging for a company or internal recruiters because often times this requires research and time outside of office hours. Good independent recruiters make this type of engagement a daily activity to increase their network and knowledge base of specific industries.If a candidate is hired during this season or any season, keep them engaged through the start date. Give them information on current projects to review and provide input, schedule lunch with their coworkers so they get to know them a little before coming in, and make the transition easy. Call them weekly and update the candidate on any exciting events from the week. Do whatever is necessary to keep in touch, to make the candidate feel wanted and welcomed.What other piece of advicewould you give growing mid-sized companies on recruiting new employees during the holiday season?No matter what your competition is doing, make sure you are recruiting. Talented people are not staying on the market for long and many will be looking for new opportunities. Give yourself the gift of the best talent available.

Want to reenergize a sluggish sales team? Consider these tips to help optimize your business' sales culture.,2016-10-26T22:30:03+00:00,Building Your Team,Leadership,"[Building Your Team, Company Culture, Employee Retention, Firing, Getting Customers, Hiring & HR, Leadership, Leadership Skills, Making a Sale, Marketing & Sales, Motivating Employees, Recruiting, Team Structure, Best of OPEN Forum, Optimize Your Day, Recommended Reads]",Building Your Team,Rieva Lesonsky,"9 Best Practices to Help Develop a Top-Selling Sales CultureRieva LesonskyContributing Writer, SmallBizTrends.comI am a small business & entrepreneurship thought leader, advocate and journalist. My mission is to help people start and grow their own businesses, which Ive been doing for over 30 years.My company, GrowBiz Media is a custom content creation company focusing on small business and entrepreneurship. We create content for small business websites and major marketers wanting to connect to entrepreneurs. We also own the small business blog, www.SmallBizDaily.com.Are your companys salespeople energetic and enthusiasticor are they lazy, entitled and content to coast on their existing accounts? If the latter, the problem may not necessarily be with your sales team, but with your sales culture.Companies that suffer from a mediocre sales culture maynever rise above so-so status, and soon, even the best salespeople can be demoralized by the negative attitudes around them. So how can you develop a top-selling sales culture that powers your sales team higher and higher? Consider following these steps.1. Hire slowly.When youre short on sales staff, it can be tempting to grab the first salesperson you find whos adequate for the job. But settling for adequate may doom your sales culture. Salespeople may behighly influenced by their team members, so if you want a top-selling culture, consider hiring top salespeople. Spend the time necessary to do thorough interviews, have the team meet the candidates, test them in role-playing situationswhatever it takes to scope out their potential.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Poorly performing salespeople may drag others down to their level. [/pullquote]2. Fire quickly.Poorly performing salespeople may drag others down to their level. Keep them on staff, and other salespeople may grow resentful and stop producing, too. If your efforts to get poor performers up to speed dont get results, consider letting the salesperson go. Hiring on a probationary basis, such as 60 to 90 days, may make this easier. Performance issues arent the only red flags of a problem salesperson. Those with bad attitudes might infect others with their negativity. Nip it in the bud or consider moving them out.3. Know your USP.What is your unique selling proposition?How do you help your customers solve their problems?How does your business stand out from the competition?These are questions that everyone in your company (not just the sales team) ideally knows the answers to. The ultimate sales culture is typically one in which every employee, from salespeople to service people to accounting clerks, can understand the role they play in serving the customer. By showing everyone how their job matters, you can hopefully build loyalty and engagement among the whole team.4. Provide ongoing training.New salespeople need training, of course, but sales training is often a continuous process. Sales managers might provide sales techniques, observe reps on sales calls, help them plan how to approach prospects and provide regular feedback. Third-party training courses or seminars may be great, but what often matters more is getting your sales team working together to share ideas, best practices and suggestions with each other.5. Use the data.Theres so much information available now to help your team make the sale. Your business might use customer relationship management (CRM) software, loyalty programs or data gathered from social media to see what your potential customers want, what needs arent being met, where the best prospects are and more. Make your companys data available to reps in ways they might use and help them harness that information to find new prospects.6. Give them the right tools.Dont expect top sales if your reps are working with outdated technology. Whether its tablet computers or sales apps, consider spending the money to get your salespeople what they need. But first, get their input. Ask reps what theyre interested in using or what tools they think would help them sell more. That way, theyre more likely to be on board when they have to learn the new system.7. Set a structure.Top-selling sales cultures tend to use processes, systems and goals to help salespeople progress. Communicate quotas, milestones and expectations to your sales team. Selling is usually a continual process of activitiescold calls, emails, etc.and without taking action, probably nothing will happen.8. Learn from mistakes.Dont punish salespeople for mistakes or lost sales, but consider using these as teaching opportunities. Role-play how the person might have handled the situation differently, or ask other reps for insights into what might work better next time.9. Maintain a high-energy environment.Sales has the potential to be an ego-crushing job, and salespeople often need positivity, strokes and motivation to keep going in the face of rejection. Keep it fun with competitions among the sales team, publicly acknowledging top salespeople and sharing successes. Take time for sales team bonding events like happy hours or karaoke nights to let your team blow off steam.Read more articles about sales and marketing.A version of this article was originally published on October 19, 2015.Photo: iStock",9 Best Practices to Help Develop a Top-Selling Sales Culture

These tips can help you conduct more conversational interviews to find an employee who's a better fit.",2016-10-26T20:30:59+00:00,Building Your Team,Company Culture,"[Building Your Team, Company Culture, Employee Retention, Hiring & HR, Interviewing, Recruiting]",Building Your Team,Kuty Shalev,"Skip the Formalities: Turn Interviews Into ConversationsKuty ShalevFounder, Managing Partner, CleverTechKuty Shalev is the founder of Clevertech, a New York City-based firm that designs, develops and deploys strategic software for businesses that want to transform themselves using the power of the web.Businesses are only as strong as the people who work for them, yet companies continue to hire the wrong people. Its no wonderwhen interviewees are nervous, they may clam up and display fewer positive attributes. This vicious cycle can lead to poor assessments by hiring committees.A good way to alleviate candidates stress and improve the quality of information gleaned during interviews can be to hold conversational interviews. When my company went through a traditional checklistcovering qualifications, skills, education and job historywithout ever delving into the motivations and personalities of the candidates, we ended up hiring people who checked all the boxes but didnt work out.After switching to a less-typical format, we found people who fit well with our company. Heres how we conduct effective, conversational interviews to help find the best candidates:1. Go back to the beginning.We dont always need to start by asking about the last thing that the candidate accomplished. Instead, we ask what he or she did early on: What did you do in college? What was your first job? What were your hobbies when you were younger?"" These types of questions give us a sense of the whole person, not just his or her resume.2. Have them tell a story.The concept of grit"" is very important at my company. To find candidates with that attribute, we ask them to tell us about a time when they wanted to accomplish something very badly but had a big obstacle in their way. This invites interviewees to tell their own stories. Then, we can hear nuances in their personalities that we might not get simply by asking, So, do you think you have grit and determination?"" Questions that elicit stories help us determine whether candidates embody the core values of our organization.3. Look for the opposite trait.We want people who take ownership and continue toward goals, despite mistakes and obstaclesnot those who will give up when confronted with difficult situations. To detect that ownership trait, we ask candidates to describe a time when they faced an injustice. After they explain the situation, we empathize and say, Oh, thats terrible!"" and then wait to see if they take the bait and continue to complain for another 10 minutes, which can indicate a victim mentality to us. However, if they describe how they persevered through unfair setbacks, we know they might be a good fit.4. Catch them off guard with bad"" questions.Conversational interviews tend to focus on the positives. We want interviewees to open up and not feel threatened, but its still important to ask weakness"" questions or make weakness"" statements, such as, Tell me why we shouldnt hire you."" Another one we ask is, What areas would your previous supervisor say you need to work on?"" These questions help us assess weaknesses, but more importantly, they give candidates a chance to demonstrate self-awareness. We want employees who are always striving to improve, and that starts with accurate self-assessment.In every interview, the goal is to uncover the motivation of the person across the table. Its easy to find people with the skills and experience were looking for, but those aspects arent always the best predictors of success. Instead, to get the kind of people who will work well on our team, we try to find out what motivates candidatesthats the real goal of a conversational interview.Photo: iStock",Skip the Formalities: Turn Interviews Into Conversations

Add politics or religion to the conversation and the heat and emotion only intensifies. The more personal the topic, the more emotional intensity is present.Unique, individual perspectives may cause disagreements to occur, believes business consultant Debora McLaughlin, author of The Renegade Leader. Values and past experiences drive our thoughts, feeling and actions. Todays political field is a battleground deeply rooted in core values. Words such as trust, integrity and character have moved to the forefront of foreign policy, homeland security and taxes. When core values are violated, these emotions increase.How PoorOffice Etiquette May Affect ProductivityWhile some discussion is to be expected, there is a point where conversations can become detrimental to the workplace.Because of our differing perspectives, disagreements are a part of being human. We see the world through our own unique lens, and most [business owners] understand the value of different perspectives, which result in innovative ideas and customer centric products or services, says McLaughlin.

These office etiquette tips can help minimize disagreements when they occur, and may help prevent them in the first place.Acknowledge the stressor. Oneway to diffuse trouble before it starts is to let employees know that you are aware of the controversy, whatever it is. For instance, in regards to the election, Goulston recommends telling employees: ""This election has been one of the most disruptive and distracting campaigns in decades. As a result, it has caused many of us to get away from the important routines we follow at work. The sooner we get back to those the better. Im not saying you dont have the right to passionately support your POV, whatever it is, but the more you compartmentalize it so that it doesnt negatively affect your work, the better.""Encourage empathy. Developing empathy amongst employees can be an important step to encouraging polite and productive communication in the office. Empathy is the ability to step into the shoes of others, be aware of their feelings and understand their needs, and in this presidential election, there seems to be no empathy taking place at all, says DeLores Pressley, CEO of DeLores Pressley Worldwide. Empathy requires listening, openness and understanding.Make expectations clear. When discussions and disagreements negativelyaffect productivity, you may want to draw the line, notes McLaughlin. Remind employees it is okay to have differing opinions, but it is not acceptable for differences to impact performance. When relating, encourage employees to eliminate the words I and you from their vocabulary. Instead, couch them to refer to the topic at hand, such as the report needs to be completed; the deadline is nearing.Instruct employees to practice good office etiquette, and walk away from disagreements. The most important thing to remind your employees of is that...there is no discussing an opposing opinion with individuals in their passion,"" says negotiations expert Eldonna Lewis-Fernandez, author of Think Like a Negotiator. ""You wont get through to them and attempting to have a viable discussion in those circumstances will end up making you crazy. Encourage employees who find themselves in an altercation to leave emotion out by remaining calm, which may calm the other person. Changing the subject may also work. If those tactics dont work, then suggest they walk away.""Read more articles onleadership.Photos: iStock",Office Etiquette: How to Handle Employee Disputes in the Workplace

Creatingone became her focus. At the same time, she began traveling to local conferences and meeting people from other governmental agencies, discussing the challenges within government. Thats when a person from a local park district asked if she ever did any consulting. She never had, but she said yes and signed on to help them devise a customer service program. Word spread and by the end of 2011, Barreto had 12 clients, all in local government. She decided to quit her day job in retail marketing and focus on her own business, advising clients on strategic planning, organization development and leader development (she now also works with corporate and nonprofit clients).Barreto meets with clients at a local park district.Relationships, says Barreto, are key in any work environment (hence the name Relationships Matter Now), and the first thing she does is set up meetings with staff throughout the organization.

In anticipation of more growth, she says she has a third consultant shes ready to hire as soon as she has the business to support the salary.At the same time, Barreto says shes been focusing on ways to diversify her offerings. Because shes a service-based business, its challenging to scale her consulting. So she recently helped create her first training video, which she plans to sell to clients. That way, she hopes that her message can reach more people and she can make a broader impact.Besides government clients, Relationships Matter Now also works with corporations and nonprofits.It took working for the government for Barreto to see a business opportunity.

Weve all seen these slogans on staff break room walls, but do they really mean anything to your people? More importantly, do they hold your team members together and push them to achieve more?Why Motivational Posters and Rallies Dont Always WorkOne of my favorite sports to watch is rowingespecially the eight-person teams. Each rower in the boat has a job to do and to do that job, they have to be completely tuned in to their teammates. The Coxswain (the person who sits facing the rowers yelling Stroke!"") keeps everyone moving to a precise rhythm, so they can operate like a well-oiled machine. If one rower gets out of sync, the boat catches a crab,"" goes over into the water and the race is over.These teamsprobably dontjust rely onmotivational posters about teamwork in the boathouse or quarterly motivational rallies and call it good. They are in the water, every single day, working on precision, speed and synchronicity. Why? Because they all hold a common goal and a common value: to have the grit and drive to be the best team on the course. They all want to deliver one perfectly executed stroke at a time and cross the finish line first. Without this, there would just be eight individuals, paddling their own way at their own rhythm. The goal would be impossible to achieve.Why Is Your Team Rowing?When I first start working with my clients, I ask them why their teams are doing what they do. Often the answers are based on a company goal (i.e. to sell more widgets,"" to be #1 in the marketplace"" or to make more money"").From the companys perspective, these answers make perfect sense. However, these answers may not be enough togive your team membersa reason to get up at four in the morning, put a boat in freezing cold water and push themselves for hours to work as a team so they can be just a little bit better than they were yesterday.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Sarah Robinson"" alignment=""center""]While each individual can absolutely figure out how they work best, learning how to work together is another skill entirely.[/pullquote]If you want to see this kind of performance from your teams, you may want to help them develop a bond based on a common value and goal. Does this take time and effort? Yes. Is this investment worth it? It can be the difference betweenho-hum or best-in-class results. If youve read this far, Im going to assume you want the latter. Here are a few steps to help get you started:1. Have a conversation.Consider asking your team members individually why they do what they do. Another helpful question to ask is what they would change about their job, and what gets in their way of doing their job. Listening to their answers openly and without judgment is important.2. Have a team meeting.During the team meeting, you can share the answers you got (without naming names). Consider giving the team the autonomy to work with the individual answers and come up with team answers to the same questions.3. Create a team goal. Using those answers, you may want to have your team develop their team value and goal. They may be tempted to use company speak"" language that they think will get approval. But think aboutchallenging them to go deeper than that by asking questions like Will that get you up in the morning after working late the night before?"", Would that be a reason to push through a team setback?"" and How does that get you more aligned as teammates?""4. Empower managers.You can encourage the teams manager to operate like the Coxswain of a rowing team. Consider telling them that they set the rhythm and the pace for the team. They can help every team member stay in sync until they cross the finish line.""I Shouldnt Have to Do All This""I hear that a lot. A commonexpectation is that team members will just magically discover the best way to work together to achieve higher and higher goals. While each individual can absolutely figure out how they work best, learning how to work together is another skill entirely. If we go back to the rowing analogy for a minute, each rower in the boat is great at rowing. But no one would expect eight great rowers to get in a boat and instantly row in sync and win all of their races.The same is true for your teams. Yes, you hired highly skilled individuals. But it takes a common value and a common goalalong with practice, coaching and experienceto bond those individuals into a high-performing team.You may want to spend time helping each team develop this common bond.

One way business owners are reducing the premiums they pay their health insurance provider is by self-insuring employees' health care themselves.,2016-11-10T22:30:36+00:00,Building Your Team,Hiring & HR,"[Benefits, Building Your Team, Healthcare, Hiring & HR, HR]",Building Your Team,Mark Henricks,"Should You Look Into Self-Insuring Employees Health?Mark HenricksFreelance WriterThe number of employers with at least one self-insured health plan has mushroomed from 28.5 percent in 1996 to 39 percent in 2015a 36.8 percent increase, according to a 2016study by theWashington, DC-based nonprofit Employee Benefits Research Institute(EBRI). The EBRI study examined data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component, ""a survey of private- and public-sector employers fielded by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.""Between 2013 and 2015, midsize and small employers led the increases, while there was a 4 percent decrease in big employers that self-insured. So why are smaller firms self-insuring employees health? ""Cost is the number one, two and three reason as to why businesses would self-insure,"" says Paul Fronstin, EBRIs director of health research and education programs. ""Theyre looking to save a few bucks.""There are a number of factors that can help employers save money by self-insuring. One, Fronstin notes, is that the passage of the Affordable Care Act placed additional rules on employers that offer traditional plans that are fully insured by a third-party health insurance company. Those rules dont apply to self-insured plans, so self-insuring allows businesses to avoid these complications and costs. (Though, given the results of the 2016 election,business owners will have to wait and see what will become of the ACA.)However, businesses considering self-insurance should realize that not all self-insured plans are cheaper at all times than their fully-insured counterparts, says Mike Ferguson, CEO of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, a trade group for self-insured employers and their partners in Simpsonville, South Carolina. ""Its not as simple as saying that if you switch to self-insured, youre going to save money,"" Ferguson says.The Realities of Self-Insuring EmployeesSelf-insured employers dont have to pay insurance premiums, which means they dont have to cover the administrative and marketing costs and profit margins of third-party insurance companies. Instead, they pay employees medical bills. And those are hard to predict accurately. A few big claims in a year can reduce savings, or even produce a loss, Ferguson says.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Dave Berg"" alignment=""center""]To me, self-funding is merely a mechanism to make sure any savings that occur would go back to me and my company and employees.Dave Berg, co-founder, Redirect Health[/pullquote]To protect themselves against unexpected high bills, many self-insured employers buy stop-loss insurance to reimburse them if an employee or employees require exceptionally costly care for some condition. Paying stop-loss premiums adds to costs, of course, but can also help employers peace of mind and, over time, smooth out losses and result in long-term savings.One of the most powerful aspects of self-insurance is that it gives employers detailed information about employee health care usage patterns. Third-party insurers generally refuse to give this data to customers. With it in hand, employers can identify things employees are doing to drive up health costs much more effectively.Self-insured employers might, for instance, see that employees are visiting hospital emergency rooms to care for non-life threatening conditions that can be much more cost-effectively treated in standalone urgent care centers. They can then tailor the plan so participants have no copays, deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses when using urgent care centers for non-emergency care.""Companies that have made those changes are seeing a change in utilization where employees are moving more toward urgent care than the ER,"" Ferguson says. Other opportunities for savings include using telemedicine, medical travel to geographic areas where care is less costly, and even operating on-site clinics.Can Self-Insuring Employees Lead to Savings?Done right, self-insurance can be a potential costcutter, says Dave Berg, co-founder of Scottsdale, Arizona-based Redirect Health, which helps companies that are self-insuring build health care plans that will capture those savings. Berg, who has also started and runs several other health care companies, says all his employees get free health care without waiting period, copays, deductibles or out-of-pocket costs. ""They cant spend any money,"" Berg says. This benefit helps him recruit and retain choice employees even in competition against much larger employers, he says.During nearly a decade of operating his own health plan and self-insuring employees, Berg says his costs for the program have consistently declined. The difference isnt self-insurance, however. Rather its carefully encouraging employees, using internally generated claims data, to choose less costly options and to stay healthy, he says. ""To me, self-funding is merely a mechanism to make sure any savings that occur would go back to me and my company and employees"" rather than to an insurance company, Berg says.The future of self-insurance will likely consist of moderate, steady growth, Fronstin says. While it clearly can work, businesses tend to be conservative and change is slow, he says. However, the prospect of additional taxes on so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" currently scheduled for 2020, may encourage more businesses to explore options such as self-insuring, he says.Is Self-Insurance Right for You?No matter what happens with the ACA, self-insurance probably isnt for everybody. Generally speaking, larger companies are better candidates for self-insuring employees health care. The number of self-insured companies in the 25- to 50-employee range is growing, but self-insurance is uncommon in companies with less than 25 employees, Ferguson says. Self-insurance also makes more sense with companies that have strong balance sheets and plenty of cash to handle unexpected claims. Those with stable workforces tend to do better with than those with high turnover.The best results are with companies that make a long-term commitment to actively managing employees health and health care use. ""If a company is simply saying, Im getting a 20 percent hike in health insurance premiums, I think Ill switch to self-insurance, and [doesnt] take time to manage the plan, its not really a good candidate for self-insurance,"" Fergusonsays.Read more articles onhealth care.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

"When it comes to hiring new team members, it helps to have a deliberate strategy in place. The following tips can help you improve your hiring process.",2016-11-08T22:30:16+00:00,Building Your Team,Hiring & HR,"[Building Your Team, Hiring & HR, HR, Interviewing, Team Structure]",Building Your Team,Anita Campbell,"10 Savvy Hiring Process Insights for Business OwnersAnita CampbellCEO, Small Business Trends LLCHi there, you can call me Anita. Im CEO at Small Business Trends LLC and Im based in Cleveland/Akron, Ohio Area.Your team can make a huge difference on the success of your business. So if your hiring process isnt bringing you the best possible candidates, its probably time to rethink it. These 10insights can help you improve your hiring process, and perhaps ultimately, your business team.1. Focus on writing the best description.If you want to attract the best candidates, havinga job posting that specifically states what you are looking for can help.Being vague or using generic-sounding statements can work against attracting great candidates. Instead, consider making a list of the exact qualities youre looking for in a candidate and outlining very clearly how you want people to apply so you dont leave them guessing about the best way to approach the opportunity.2. Use social media as part of your hiring process.Candidates want to work for companies that offer dynamic workplace environments and embrace exciting new trends and technologies. Social media can be a great way to make your business appeal to potential candidates. And the better your business comes across online, the more likely you are to convince the very best people to apply for any open positions. Plus, social media can be a great tool for learning more about potential candidates once they start the process of applying.3. Make candidates show attention to detail.When you create a job posting, you mayget plenty of responses rolling in. That can potentially get overwhelming and could even be a waste of time and resources. But you can cut out some of that time by including really specific instructions within your job posting.Even something simple like telling them to use a certain subject line for their email can quickly tell you which candidates were paying attention and actually read through the job posting. Then you dont have to worry about wading through the emails of the people who didnt follow instructions.4. Do prior research.Once you get some applicants, but before you start on the time-consuming interview process, you can do some research about your top candidates so that you dont waste time interviewing those who dont appear to be a good fit.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Anita Campbell"" alignment=""center""]Hiring interns or seasonal employees can actually be a great way to get an idea of how candidates work and how they fit in with your team.[/pullquote]If you can easily find social media posts or other information online about candidates that show they arent a good fit, then theres no point in spending the time to bring them in for an interview. In addition, you might also find some information about candidates that could make them stand out in a good way.5. Ask unconventional interview questions.During the actual interview process, you can ask all the standard questions like those about work history and strengths and weaknesses. But you can potentially learn even more about candidates by asking questions they arent expecting.You canstill ask about things that are actually relevant. But if you can ask a few things that arent on the standard list of interview questions, like what candidates might do in a specific situation, you can potentially get a better idea of their personality and how well they think on their feet.6. Ask for examples.In addition, even when you do ask standard questions, its important to dig deeper into their responses, since many job applicants may have canned answers to standard questions.For example, when someone gives you a few of their strengths during the interview process, you could ask them about a time when they used those strengths in a professional environment.7. Focus on skills over experience.Experience is important in many different fields. But you may not want it to be the only thing that matters. If you have to choose between a candidate who has 10 years of experience working in the field and one who only has a couple years of experience but has all the right skills, is a fast learner and meshes well with your company culture, you dont necessarily have to go with the candidate with more experience. Skills and the ability to work well within your team can prove to be much more important over time.8. Consider the candidates personality.While it shouldnt be your only determining factor, a candidates personality can also make a big difference when it comes to how effective they can be for your company. Youmay want to considerhiring people who are going to work well with the rest of your team, especially if you want to foster a collaborative workplace environment. Consider keeping that in mind during the hiring process, and ask questions that are going to give you an idea of how each candidate might work within your team.9. Find out what they expect from you.Hiring isnt a one-way street. If you want your new hires to be as effective as possible, gain an understanding from them about what they expect and what will help them be an effective team member.During the interview and hiring process, considergiving them an opportunity to share their thoughts and ask you questions as well. Opening those channels of communication can be a great way to set the tone for a positive working relationship early on.10. Consider a trial period.When youre hiring new team members, you dont necessarily have to make it permanent right from the start. Hiring interns or seasonal employees can actually be a great way to get an idea of how candidates work and how they fit in with your team.If youre happy with their performance after that period of time, you can offer them a more permanent position. And if you arent, then you can move on and try out someone new for another season.Read more articles onhiring & HR.Photo: iStock",10 Savvy Hiring Process Insights for Business Owners
How you approach the topic of workplace injuries can have a profound effect on the likelihood of accidents and the speed at which injured employees return.,2016-10-21T17:30:07+00:00,Building Your Team,Company Culture,"[Benefits, Building Your Team, Company Culture, Employee Retention, Hiring & HR, HR]",Building Your Team,Julie Bawden Davis,"What Steps Can You Take to Help Protect Your Team From Workplace Injuries?Julie Bawden DavisWriter/Author/Publisher/Speaker, Garden Guides PressHi there, you can call me Julie. Im Writer/Author/Publisher/Speaker at Garden Guides Press and Im based in Orange County, California Area.A 2016 U.S. Department of Labor reportrecently revealed some unfortunaterealities when it comes to workplace injuries. According to the report, when Americanworkers are injured, theyreat risk of becoming economically disadvantaged. This is because many state workers compensation systems are falling short and failing to provide adequate benefits when accidentsoccur.While you probably cant singlehandedly change the system, you can trytoprevent injuries from happening in the first placein your own company. And when accidents do occur, you can help minimize the financial risks to employees by seeing that they get back on the job as soon as possible.Injury prevention is a top concern for any small business owner, says Laura Putnam, author of Workplace Wellness That Works. Occupational safety, for organizations of all sizes, has largely been defined as a matter of training and enforcement of rules, despite evidence to suggest that it runs much deeper.Putnam believes the key to helping prevent workplace injuriesand minimize their negative effects on employeesis to take the focus away from injuries and focus instead on wellness and safety.Promote Health and SafetyCongress passed the Health and Safety Act, not the Health or Safety Act. As the name rightly suggests, health and safety go hand in hand, says Putnam, who is also CEO and founder of Motion Infusion. By integrating health promotion efforts and safety into the workplace, you enhance the overall workplace culture, which reduces health and safety-related risks, while increasing engagement.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Laura Putnam"" alignment=""center""]Your efforts to help employees start working again may help send a message to the rest of the staff: If they are injured at any point, youll do what you can to get them back on the job in a timely manner.[/pullquote]The truth is that poor health leads to what is known as presenteeism, says Putnam. This occurs when an employee is at work, but out of it. Presenteeism puts employees at grave risk in regards to their safety.Promoting health can also help speed up recovery time when workplace injuries occur. A healthy worker is more likely to recover more quickly than a less healthy worker, says Putnam.Foster a Shared Sense of OwnershipAknee-jerk response to workplace injuries may be blaming the employee for carelessness and clamp down with no go rules, believes Putnam.Such negative, penalizing responses are not effective. Rather than imposing rules and training that feels punitive, the real solution lies in devising ways to instill a sense of shared ownership among employees, she says. The reality is that most workers already know the safety rules, along with the consequences of not following them. And, yet, injuries caused by noncompliance are far too common. Therefore, a small-business owner would be wise to devise ways to replace a top-down do this or else approach with a shared sense of ownership.Fostering camaraderie in the workplace can help promote a shared sense of ownership. At one Swedish-based construction company, for example, ""workers don hard hats that feature their family photos, says Putnam. These images drive home the message that safety on the job is about returning home safely to ones family. In a sense, that family is also part of the workplace, so staying safe on the job can mean staying safe for the good of the entire company.Show Authentic ConcernOccupational injuries and safety-related fatalities may be less a matter of behaviors per se, and more a matter of the conditions that lead to these risky behaviors in the first place, says Putnam. A key factor is perceived organizational support, or the extent to which employees feel that their employer authentically cares about them. Employees perceptions of the extent to which they feel that they are valued by and cared for by their organization can have an enormous impact on issues like engagement, presenteeism and safety. [It]can go a long way toward avoiding accidents and injuries in the first place.One way business owners canshow concern is by advising employees of their rights under workers compensation laws. This can be based on the assistance generally given by your state, including the potential financial and medical help they can expect if an injury occurs. This information can help them makedecisions about their personal health insurance in case they need to use their medical insurance to get adequatemedical care in the event that their states workers compensation isntsufficient.Set up Conditions for a Speedy Re-entry to the WorkforceSetting up conditions so that your employees get back on the job as soon as possible can have a variety of benefits. Doing what you can to ensure a speedy re-entry into the workforce can be good for the employeeand his or her bank account. It can also help boost morale and contribute to a positive company culture.Your efforts to help employees start working again may help send a message to the rest of the staff: If they are injured at any point, youll do what you can to get them back on the job in a timely manner. Here are some actionsyou can take to help facilitate a speedy return:When workplace injuries occur, consider encouraging injuredemployees to follow the steps necessary to receive workers compensation and medical assistance.Check in on a regular basis to see how the recovery is progressing. Keeping an open dialogue with your injured employee can help you show your concern and make it clear that you are only a phone call away if help is needed.Let them knowthat there is no rush. Stress that his or her welfare comes first and the employee should only return when he or she feels strong and capable enough to perform duties safely and efficiently.Allow the employee to ease back into work. Consider having the employee returnon a part-time basis for the first few weeks.Read more articles on hiring & HR.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

The net result can help a company run more efficiently and effectively.Externally, one of the objectives of harnessing big data is to create a better customer experience. By gathering data, analyzing it and then acting on it, smart companies can strengthen the relationship they have with their customers.Internally, forward-thinking companies are learning more about cognitive computing and systems. IBM defines cognitive systems as ""a category of technologies that uses natural language processing and machine learning to enable people and machines to interact more naturally to extend and magnify human expertise and cognition."" Companies who are exploring cognitive computing may also realize the importance of having someone who can play the role of digital orchestra leader. They may want to hire a chief digital officerwhocan connect all of the departments together with cognitive computing.3. Have a competitive advantagefor now.There is a quote I often use in my workshops and presentations:In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.This can be true ofthe digital landscape in business today. Whereas some companies are way out in front and have mastered the art of doing business in a digital economy, many businesses, large and small, are still blind to the opportunities. Thats the good news. The bad news is that they wont be blind forever.Hiring a chief digital officer may help place your business on the right side of the digital divide.Read more articles on hiring & HR.Photo: iStock",Should Your Company Hire a Chief Digital Officer?
"The ACA marketplace continues to experience volatility and increasing costs, so some business owners are trying health insurance alternatives.",2016-09-02T19:30:24+00:00,Building Your Team,Hiring & HR,"[Building Your Team, Cash Flow, Healthcare, Hiring & HR, Managing Money]",Building Your Team,Julie Bawden Davis,"Health Insurance: Should You Consider Self-Insuring?Julie Bawden DavisWriter/Author/Publisher/Speaker, Garden Guides PressHi there, you can call me Julie. Im Writer/Author/Publisher/Speaker at Garden Guides Press and Im based in Orange County, California Area.As open enrollment for health insurance approaches later this yearand some insurers plan to leave the Affordable Care Act marketplacesproviding employees with health insurance is becoming increasingly complicated.The group health plan marketplace for smaller and mid-sized employers has become more unstable and expensive due to general uncertainties about the future of health care reform and thelack of competition among traditional insurance companies, notes Michael Ferguson, president & CEO of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, Inc. (SIIA). The result of this uncertainty is that some businesses are considering and adopting self-insurance.In recent years, traditional health insurance sources have been drying up, particularly for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees, says Ernie Clevenger, president of CareHere LLC, a company that self-insures for medical insurance.With some insurance companies reviewing or pulling out of exchanges, the supply of health insurance is decreasing. Meanwhile, demand for health insurance is increasing, particularly as the Affordable Care Acts penalties for businesses that fail to provide insurance increase, says Clevenger. With supply down and demand up, the price of conventional insurance is rising. Consequently, many small businesses are exploring alternative benefit arrangements, including self-insurance, that allow them to provide high-quality benefits and avoid the volatility in the conventional insurance market.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Ernie Clevenger"" alignment=""center""]Because employers are directly responsible for the cost of their employees care, they have a significant incentive to invest in their employees health.Ernie Clevenger, president,CareHere LLC[/pullquote]Kate Amdor is manager, compensation and benefits for Telligen, Inc., which also self-insures. The traditional health insurance approach for small-business owners is to work with a broker to develop a financial plan, which is typically a fully-insured product, she says. Unfortunately, like with most insurance products, business owners find they eventually pay more than their expected losses.Facing what Amdor believes to be double-digit premium hikes year after year and increasing related fees that threaten profits, many small-business owners are increasingly considering self-funding their health plans, backed by stop-loss insurance for large claims. Its a calculated risk, but done the right way, self-funding a health plan with stop-loss coverage typically costs less than fully-insuring the plan, over time, says Amdor.How Common Is Self-Insuring?Self-insuring is not new and more popular than might be expected. According to The Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust 2015 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey (Kaiser/HRET) from a telephone survey of 1,997 randomly selected public and private employers with three or more workers, 17 percent of workers with insurance at small firms are enrolled in plans that are partially or completely self-funded. Overall, 63 percent of workers are enrolled in self-funded plans. Of those 63 percent, 60 percent also have what is known as stop-loss coverage, which is additional insurance in the case of high claims.What Are the Benefits of Self-Insuring?According to those companies that have gone the self-insurance route, there are a variety of good reasons to self-insure.The three main benefits of self-insurance involve cost, control and access to data, says Ferguson. Well-run self-insured group health plans are generally more cost-effective over time when compared to traditional insurance arrangements, although year-to-year experience often varies. Employers that self-insure also maintain control of how their health plan is structured, which contrasts with standardized plans sold by insurance companies. Self-insured employers are also able to access their own claims data, subject to certain HIPAA restrictions, which allows for greater efficiency in plan management.Self-insurance may also allow companies to provide more comprehensive and customized benefits for their employees designed to increase overall health, which can save money in the long run.Because employers are directly responsible for the cost of their employees care, they have a significant incentive to invest in their employees health, says Clevenger. He notes that employers are increasingly offering employees innovative options for receiving care, like free medical center clinics within the workplace and access to data analytics software that identifies potentially costly health risks so that early intervention is possible.Providing services that allow employees to truly improve their health is an ideal way for small-business owners to decrease healthcare costs in the long-run, agrees Amdor. Good claims years when claims expenses run lower than expected allow the business owner to create reserves for the tougher years.What Are the Drawbacks of Self-Insuring?There are, of course, cons to self-insuring, and self-insurance isnt for every business, believes Ferguson. Clearly, one of the main considerations is understanding that when you are self-insured, youre on the hook to pay claims as they are incurred. Some of these claims may be large. Even though most employers purchase stop-loss insurance as a financial backstop, employers need to understand this obligation.Business owners new to self-funding must have the stomach for the years in which the health claims they pay are higher than expected, says Amdor. If they havent yet built up good reserves, claims expenses may affect their financial performance.Clevenger agrees. The biggest possible con of self-funding is that it requires businesses to have an understanding of the risk theyre taking on. By self-funding, firms assume responsibility for the financing of their employees health care. They must take that responsibility seriously.There is also a substantial time commitment involved in reviewing and analyzing plan performance. The best-run self-insured health plans are monitored by the companys executive team, says Ferguson. Self-insurance should not be seen as a simple, one-time business decision that can be ignored later on.How Can YouSuccessfully Self-Insure?In order to decide if self-insuring is right for your business, Clevenger suggests conducting a side-by-side comparison of the annual cost of a fully insured plan with the annual cost of a self-funded plan and then projecting that comparison five years out into the future. Third-party administrators, including health benefit brokers or consultants, can run models to project costs under a self-funding arrangement versus your current fully insured plan.If youre interested in self-insurance, seek out knowledgeable brokers, consultants and/or third party administrators who can thoroughly evaluate this option. Confirm that such advisors have successful experience with self-insured plans, advises Ferguson, who notes that a listing of advisors can be found on www.siia.org.Read more articles on healthcare.Photo: iStockThe information contained in this article is for generalized informational and educational purposes only and is not designed to substitute for, or replace, a professional opinion about any particular business or situation or judgment about the risks or appropriateness of any financial or business strategy or approach for any specific business or situation.

You know the onesyou leave them with an hours worth of work and it takes two days before theyre finished.Theres good news, though: Not only are there strategies for increasing these slow employees work speed, but when you follow these steps, youmay alsoget better quality work out of them, too.1. Determine why your employees are slow.Just simply ask. Explain that youve noticed their speed isnt up to par and ask whats slowing them down. They might be confused. They might be so detail-oriented, theyre getting caught up in particulars that dont matter to you. They may even know their performance is subpar and be glad you asked. In any case, a number of things may be causing employees to work slower than youd like, and the first step toward a solution is determining the underlying cause.2. Team up with them.Employees may get defensive when they feel backed into a corner, and thats the opposite of what you want. It may help to make it clear youre there to help, not simply point the finger and walk away. Ask, What can we do to improve this situation? or How can I help? Sometimes the answer is there, you just have to ask the question.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" alignment=""center""]Employees who feel overwhelmed may end up accomplishing very little, but if you feed them tasks a few at a time, they may be able to knock out phenomenal amounts of work.[/pullquote]3. Give clear deadlines with priorities.You know which tasks are most important, but do your employees? While its great to give your staff to-do lists, it may help to prioritize tasks, or you may run the risk of your employees taking care of the least demanding and important tasks first. And dont forget about Parkinsons Law, that work expands to fill the time we allot for it. Dont be afraid to give your staff clear and demanding deadlines. You wont know how quickly they can turn projects around unless you push them.4. Limit distractions.Employees who feel overwhelmed may end up accomplishing very little, but if you feed them tasks a few at a time, they may be able to knock out phenomenal amounts of work. You might try to find ways to streamline your problem employees environments and give them the chance to succeed. Keep in mind that we may be distracted by different things. Ive learned that I cant have my email up and running if Im trying to complete a complex task by a deadline, as Im likely to be sidetracked by client questions. Determine what gets your slow employees off task and try to address those issues.5. Find out what your employees like to do.When you take the time to explore the tasks that make your staff feel fulfilled, youre really trying to find out what theyre good at. While you cant assign everyone only the tasks they enjoy, it often makes sense to work to your employees strengths. If you can balance jobs that feel like drudgery with jobs they love, your employees maybe happier and less likely to drag their heels. You dont have to treat work like preschool, but employees who feel a balance of fulfilled and challenged may be the most productive.6. Give regular feedback.So you meet with your slow employees, find out what the problems are and develop a plan to speed up their work completion. The critical last step is to follow up. Consider planning a series of meetings to discuss their performance and progress and decide how things are going. It may also be important to set incremental goals. When you have otherwise good employees who simply lag a bit, you dont want to have to fire them if their first evaluation shows they havent achieved absolutely everything. Rewarding incremental progress may help you keep the tone positive, while still working toward your end goal. Constructive criticism and a focus on what theyve accomplished may make the meeting a positive one, rather than something theyll dread.An added benefit to addressing the problem of slow employees in a pragmatic fashion is youre modeling a positive method of conflict resolution in your business. Your staff sees that while you have high expectations, you dont expect perfection. Theyll hopefully understand that you value them and their contribution enough to work toward better results. Feeling supported and valued often translates into loyal, long-term employees, ones you can trust to deliver on time.Read more articles about motivating employees.A version of this article was originally published on November 6, 2015.Photo: iStock",6 Steps to Help Slow Employees Work Faster

Have you ever experienced self-doubt as a business owner? Impostor syndrome is commonâ€”but it doesn't have to get in the way of your success.,2016-10-12T16:30:25+00:00,Building Your Team,Leadership,"[Building Your Team, Leadership, Leadership Skills, Personal Productivity, Presenting, Productivity]",Building Your Team,Bruna Martinuzzi,"5 Tips to Help Overcome Impostor SyndromeBruna MartinuzziPresident and Founder, Clarion Enterprises Ltd.Bruna Martinuzzi is the CEO of Clarion Enterprises Ltd., specializing in leadership and presentation skills training. She is the author of Presenting with Credibility (2012) and The Leader as a Mensch (2009). Bruna has helped thousands of individuals become more effective communicators. www.clarionenterprises.comImpostor syndrome describes individuals fears of not being as adequate, competent or intelligent, as others view them. Typical symptoms may include feeling like a fraud or aphony. This can lead to anxiety about being unmasked or being ""found out"" as an impostor. Those who experience impostor syndrome may suffer from self-doubt. This may make them incapable of taking credit for their accomplishments and successes. They may feel that their success is a fluke, which can lead them to belittle or discount their achievements.Impostor syndrome typically involves individuals who are high achievers, intelligent and accomplished. Theres a misconception that impostor syndrome primarilyaffects women, and especially professional women or women in business. But men, too, are subject to it. It can affect anyone from scientists, academics, programmers, actors, authors, librarians, to entrepreneurs and executives. A 2015 study by Vantage Hill Partners, a UK consulting firm, shows that even CEOs experience impostor syndrome. The study, which involved 116 companies, revealed that one of the top fears of CEOs is being found to be incompetent.Even Albert Einstein may have experienced some aspect of this syndrome. ""The exaggerated esteem in which my lifework is held,"" he said, ""makes me very ill at ease. I feel compelled to think of myself as an involuntary swindler.""If you think you might suffer from impostor syndrome, try this test. It might help you determine whether you have impostor syndrome characteristics.So, what can be done to manage, or overcome, impostor syndrome? Here are some suggestions to consider:1. Dont fake it.Well-meaning advice is to ""fake it until you make it."" But this might only reinforce the feeling of being an impostor.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Bruna Martinuzzi"" alignment=""center""]Whether youre a business owner, a professional or an entrepreneur, impostor syndrome can sap your energy and discourage you from going out there and pursuing your goals for success.[/pullquote]Instead of faking anything, consider focusing on increasing your competency in whatever you undertake. Devoting whatever time and effort is required to own your area of expertise can help you feel less like a phony. When we genuinely practice what we know, theres no need to fake it. Theres power in being authentically who we are and doing work were qualified to do.In that vein, you maynot want to take on any challenges where you genuinely feel that you arent qualified or where you know you dont have what it takes in that particular area. If its too much, acknowledge it. Acknowledging legitimate concerns can help free you to focus on what youre good at.2. Boost your self-efficacy.Self-efficacy is not our ability to do something, but rather our belief in our ability. One way you can increase your self-efficacy is through mastery experiences. This means having successful experiences through repeated effort. Lets take public speaking as an example. By repeatedly speaking in public, or delivering presentations, you can overcome obstacles to speaking well.Successes that you achieve through persistence and doggedness can lead to mastery experiences.Another way to boost your self-efficacy is through vicarious experiences. This means watching individuals who are similar to you achieve success through perseverance. This can increase your belief that you, too, can improve your performance in similar activities.3. Cut yourself some slack.Its safe to say that almost everyone who is a high achiever may have, at one time or other, worried that they may not be as capable as others may view them. Perhaps this is what philosopher Bertrand Russell had in mind when he said that ""the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.""Instead of self-flagellation, consider practicing self-compassion. Reminding yourself that youre not alone in this can help you reduce your fears.Worrying about how others may view you is natural. Its an indication that you care. Theres humility in worryingand some humility is an attractive trait. It can trump arrogance. And heres something to keep in mind: Real impostors probably dont experience the pangs of the impostor syndrome!4. Practice metacognition.Metacognition is not only an awareness of our own thinking, but also an analysis of our own thinking. Simply put, its thinking about thinking. Since impostor syndrome typically involves thoughts and feelings about ones performance, rather than the actual performance itself, it pays to raise your awareness of whats happening in the moment.One way to do this is to try and catch yourself when self-doubt starts to creep in. Pause for a moment, and ask yourself:Is my self-doubt justifiable?What hard evidence is there to validate my fears?What scripts am I carrying in my head?Who put them there?Am I allowing my emotions to highjack my logical brain?Are my feelings a result of emotional exhaustion? (e.g., Have I over-extended myself?)Do I need to change my strategy?5. Cultivate mental and emotional poise.When we practice mental and emotional poise, were more likely to achieve that wonderful state of balance, of equilibrium. We can do this when we acknowledge that were doing our very best to learn and know our craft. There are other ways to achieve this: For one thing, stopping the tyranny of comparisons. As Mark Twain put it, ""comparison is the death of joy."" As well, stop seeking external validation. Why choose to depend on others judgments, opinions and possible biases?Finally, consider reminding yourself that the costs of perpetuating impostor syndrome far outweigh any possible benefits. For example, the anxiety that accompanies such feelings can be an unnecessary distraction.

We can save time, but we cant buy it; we can kill time and make time, but we cantgo back or forward in time.But we can use our time better if we think about it. Here are a three ways you can turn time to your businesss advantage.The Powerful PauseYou can make the so-called awkward pause your tool in business conversations. Most of us grow increasingly uncomfortable with silence in a meeting. We want to fill those pauses. But instead of filling the pause, consider using it to your advantage.For example, imagine that youre a buyer in a sales pitch. The seller delivers pricing and terms. You pause. Silence swells. You wait. Quite often the seller will fill the notoriously awkward silence by lowering the price and sweetening the terms.You havent even said no yet. You seem to be thinking about it. But the dynamic around the pause may end up sweetening the deal for you.[pullquote showtweet=""false"" username=""Tim Berry"" alignment=""center""]As business owners we want to solve problems. Its hard to wait for solutions that take time. Not waiting, however, can be inefficient and counterproductive.[/pullquote]I learned about the power of the pause while consulting for an American company in Japan. It turned out that there was a simple cultural difference that played out in favor of Japanese people negotiating with Americans. In our culture, the pause is uncomfortable. In Japan, it is often a sign of respect. The scene I suggest above played out often with Americans selling to Japanese people.That was decades ago. That cross-cultural phenomenon may not even be still true today. However, whether that detail is still true or not, the pause can be very powerful when used well. Think how it could help you in negotiations and meetings. Those few seconds can be time well spent.The Waiting GameWe all want to be decisive when it comes to making business decisions. But at times there are very good reasons to put a decision off for later.1. When more information is coming later.It might be an upcoming sales conference, a meeting, next months sales, results or input from somebody else. Having more information coming can be a good reason to wait on making a decision.2. When there isnt a penalty for waiting.Since I started using this framework, Ive been frequently surprised with how often wemake decisions quickly when there is no penalty for waiting until later. Thats more obvious when you know more information is coming. But even when you dont think more information is coming, if theres no penalty for waiting, you can wait. You might get information you hadnt expectedor maybe you get insight from your subconscious mind. You may have something to gainand nothing to lose.3. When you have a gut instinct.Its the common-sense idea of Lets sleep on it. Sometimes decisions are better when you let them sit for a while. The quasi-scientific explanation might be letting the subconscious mind work on it.The Slow SimmerDo you ever turn to a recurring problem, get impatient, forget that theres a solution already underway and jump ahead with another new solution? Ive done that more often than I want to admit. I end up not giving the first solution time to cook before jumping in with a second and even a third solution to the same problem.Business ownership can be full of problems that take time to solve. You might be changing systems, developing software, remodeling space, looking for some new hire and so forth. Meanwhile, the problem reoccurs and frustration sets in. Very often you should take a step back, remind yourself that things are cooking, and wait until they are done.That can be hard to do. As business owners, we want to solve problems. Its hard to wait for solutions that take time. Not waiting, however, can be inefficient and counterproductive. Clearly its not efficient to throw a second or third solution to a single problem before the first has the time to work.Quick isnt always better. Dont rush when patience can work better for your businessget time on your side.Read more articles onproductivity.Photo: iStock",Using Time and Timing as Business Power Tools
